Minutes - 2/25/91 BoD Meeting

These are indeed the Official Minutes of the Meeting of the Board of
Directors of the Open Computing Facility.  Accept no substitute.

I don't even remember when the meeting started, and at this point,
it's pretty unimportant.  The same could be said for the meeting
as a whole, but I'm not the one to say it.  

Those who attended were: 
	appel 		blojo		dpassage	glass		
	gwh		ianb		mehlhaff	steveg		
	welch		yukai

Networking quote:
	dpassage: I could telnet to typhoon from annex.
	welch: I could send a carrier pigeon from Bechtel...

Topics: 
	rsr - roy by any other name... (Roy S. Rapoport)

	Should we nuke him or not?  After much too much discussion we 
	decided that in our infinite generosity, we would give him this
	one last chance.  Please note, that this is somewhat dated at
	this point, but that's the way things were last week.  We'll
	know better next time...

	General Meeting

	We are looking at sometime next week for the General Meeting. 
	The exact time and place remain in question (and since these
	are being typed in what was to be the next week in question,
	I'm not so sure...) but look for detail in the near future.

For next week:
	Printers are almost working.
	Roy goes away, I mean, we reconsider his membership.
	General Meeting details hammered out.
		help session, ammendments
	Better minutes through better meetings...
