This are the [late] minutes of the BOD for the week of 11/07/91.

ATTENDANCE:
	I distinctly remember the following people being around. 

	alanc	nweaver	cgd	pbrown	dpassage	glass
	lee	norby	psb	gwh	welch		richter
	karat	davidf	rsr

A long discussion on whether or not staff was being 'squish-happy' and
whether or not people who share their account are doing a bad think or a Bad
Thing(tm) ensued. . .

19:42:  cgd used the word "reclacitrant", apparently completely
sponteniously.

20:09   gwh mentioned jen[n].  

20:17	"Zork is a wonderful game.  It is the only true game" (psb)

20:18:  dpassage mentioned Margaret

20:19   "Beat me, beat me" (cgd [Is this a frequent fantasy chris?  should we
	tell jen[n]?])

20:31:	"If you're doing anything useful you're in emacs anyway" (psb)

20:49	"I actually agree with them " (name withheld"

Hey nicholas!! Fascist:  F-A-S-C-I-S-T

Nothing much was decided, to the best of my knowledge.

				Have a nice day,
				Roy S. Rapoport
