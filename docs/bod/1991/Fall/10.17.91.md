Following are the official minutes for the OCF Board of Directors meeting of
thursday, 10/17/91

The meeting started at 7:04 BST

1)  Attendance:
	The following people were not anywhere that was not 120 Bechtel:
	(! Marks non-bod members)
	!ctl		karat		davidf		pbrown
	adam		norby		dpassage	!blojo
	!welch		alanc		nweaver		rsr
	kmorgan		gwh		

2)  Quorum
	we had (as you can see) 11 Board members, which 
	was slightly less than the 16 people that we needed.  As such,
	everything discussed in there has no value what-so-ever. . .

3)  Game Policy
	We decided that the game policy should be more extensively 
	publicised and understood.

				Have a nice day,
				Roy S. Rapoport
