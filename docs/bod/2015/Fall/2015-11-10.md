   - Need storage space "a few times a semester"
   - Have a lot of stuff to store, like yearbooks from 1901
   - They can store stuff against the wall
   - In principle they should not have cardkey to storage room and pubstaff
     should let them in
   - Agreed not to use the "emergency" door once the lab opens
 - What to do with TV?
   - Build Mini ITX and mount behind TV
   - Should be x86 because ARM stuff tends to be too unpowerful
 - What to display on TV?
   - Print queue
     - Maybe we should put this on a monitor next to the printers

     - Maybe we can display staff currently in the lab as well

   - <frame>/<iframe>
   - Four windows tiled using twm
 - Will there be burn-in?
   - nickimp thinks not
   - It's not a plasma TV
   - The EECS TVs have "weird shifty thingies" i.e. "white bars that go across
     the screen"
 - mattmcal (and maybe peterwu) would like to buy a paper shredder
   - Need a quality shredder so it won't break on people's random stuff
   - nickimp doubts that anyone would want to use the shredder
     - The rest of us disagree
   - nickimp proposes allocating $150 for paper shredder
     - Unanimous

Meeting is adjourned at 8:14 pm.
