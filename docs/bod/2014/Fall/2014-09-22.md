  - New staff will be emailed shortly with link
  - Put all hours that work, we'll choose best ones later and send
    another form
- 10 minute tech talk: OCF networking and connecting from outside
  - Slides available at:
    https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~staff/bod/2014/Fall/2014-09-22.pdf
  - OCF has two internet lines from IST: one behind firewall, one with
    no firewall
  - In practice everything is behind the firewall
    - (but some things allow all traffic)
  - All outbound traffic allowed (except mail)
  - Inbound traffic
    - None to desktops
    - Some to some servers
    - SSH to login servers
    - Full to hozers
  - OCF has two login servers:
    - tsunami, for public people, restricted access to rest of ocf
    - supernova, for staffers, full access to rest of ocf
  - Use supernova as a bastion to access other servers
    - step 1: ssh me@supernova.ocf.berkeley.edu
    - step 2: ssh whatever-server
  - Can also use hozers, but eventually we will protect the rest of the
    ocf from them
- Budget allocations
  - ckuehl suggests purchasing 3 new SSDs for jaws
    - 2 for use, 1 for space; total 8 in jaws
    - Estimated cost ~$600, ask to allocate $700
      - 3 SSDs, 2 SSD adapters
      - BoD approves
      - [annotation by ckuehl: actual cost was $580]
 - ckuehl suggests purchasing 2 additional monitors to create 2 more
   computers with dual monitors
   - Estimated cost: ~$550, ask to allocate $700
   - Concerns:
     - do people use the lab for more than printing?
       - we want them to, plus staff do
       - currently the dual monitors are mostly unused
     - is this best use of money?
  - Decision to postpone until next meeting (running out of time)
- Next meeting:
  - Vote on proposed amendment:
    https://github.com/ocf/wiki/compare/ckuehl-proposed-amendment
    (Also quoted below since 2015-06-26)
  - Discuss lending out resources
  - Discuss more staff processes
- ckuehl will add staff privileges by tomorrow, send email with details
- Welcome to the staff team!
