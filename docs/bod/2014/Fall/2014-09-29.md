- Administrative stuff
  - Welcome to new staff!
    - Sign up for staff hours (see the Google Doc in your email)
    - If you want Google Apps for your @ocf email, contact Chris
  - Card-key access
    - If you've been staff for at least one semester, you're eligible
    - Process is complicated; Chris will send another with details
- Blue & Gold (yearbook) use of OCF lab
  - In the past, space was shared because of close relationship via Dara
    (GM of OCF, B&G staff member)
    - Shared before Dara too, but in a much larger space, and not to
      the same extent
  - Last year, significant problems with B&G lab use
    - Garbage/trash left in lab despite warnings
    - Computers/scanners/equipment moved or unplugged
    - Lights left on, door left open
  - Other problems
    - Disruptive to OCF staff who want to use the lab for OCF-related
      work, often unscheduled
    - Security concerns
  - Considered cutting off lab access entirely over the summer
    - Probably better to allow some use, but need to set guidelines
  - Two times lab might be used:
    - Scheduled meetings (Thursday nights)
      - Lots of people (estimate 35+) in lab for some time
    - Unscheduled meetings
      - Working in lab
  - Due to miscommunication, B&G was using the lab without our
    knowledge (but in good faith, and they thought we were aware)
  - BoD consensus after lengthy discussion:
    - Use of lab Thursday nights is ok
      - At least one EIC must be present at all times
      - Lab must be left clean, lights off, etc.
      - Permitted times 6pm-11pm (not before lab closes, not after 11pm)
      - Cannot exceed legal max occupancy (need to check what it is)
        - Safety (only one exit, small space, etc.)
    - Unscheduled ad-hoc use of lab is not ok
      - Security concerns are too significant
        (even first-semester OCF staff don't get this access)
  - Nick and Chris to meet next Thursday to discuss and relay BoD
    decision to B&G
- Lending out OCF resources to student groups
  - Good idea, but tricky to implement
  - Primary concerns
    - Maintenance of servers
      - Who is responsible for updates?
      - Do groups get root?
  - Try it on a trial basis
    - Will discuss next meeting with a (hopefully) more concrete example
    - Groups will be required to renew after some term (e.g. every
      semester, but might vary by group)
- Vote to amend the Constitution with amendment presented last meeting
  - Updates discrimination and membership language to be in-line with
    university requirements
  - Passes unanimously
- Allocate $700 to buy dual monitors
  - Purchase 2 new monitors, move existing monitor to another PC
  - Creates 2 computers with dual monitors
  - Passes unanimously
  - [annotation by ckuehl: actual cost was $557]
- Ideas for new services/projects
  - Setting up Hadoop or Spark?
    - Good for students/groups who want to run something, but don't want
      to set up the infrastructure
    - Probably need to clear requests (to avoid people mining
      bitcoins...)
    - Could run it on the powerful desktops
  - Purchasing a large-format printer
    - Lots of students, especially outside of CS, have to print large
      posters
      - Painful, difficult, expensive
    - Would be a useful service
    - Likely to be expensive and difficult to manage
- Next time
  - Discuss building staff computer, more lab improvements

Meeting ended at 7:01pm
