- Updates on building computers
  - Start by building a staff computer, move on to other computers if a success
  - Send your builds (budget < $1000) to Chris and Nick before Wednesday
  - Discuss changes, will discuss at next BoD and maybe purchase

- Printing costs
  - We're printing even more than last year
    - More people printing
    - Larger daily cap (15 instead of 10)
    - ~3500 pages per weekday average
    - 1 toner, 2.5 cases paper per week
      - Actually seem to be using more paper than this :(
  - Budget is about $10,000 per year for printing
  - Projections
    - At current rates, with genuine toner and 100% recycled paper:
      - monthly: $1,625
      - yearly: $12,500
    - At current rates, with genuine toner and FSC-certified paper:
      - monthly: $1,425
      - yearly: $10,900
    - (note: these numbers assume high paper costs, especially for
      non-recycled; we can usually get slightly cheaper)
  - Prefer to limit printing or switch to FSC (but non-recycled) paper?
    - BoD unanimous on using FSC paper, although prefer recycled if/when we can
      get it cheaply
    - Difficult to justify spending significantly more for 100% recycled paper
      - Ask ASUC for more money next year?
  - High possibility we still need to limit printing
    - Wait until spring if possible
  - Chris reached out to Staples to ask for better prices
    - Spoke with account rep, waiting to hear back later this week
  - This will be a _much_ bigger problem next year when moving to the new space
    - More computers, bigger space
    - Almost certainly more printing
    - Still need to eventually replace the aging printers

- Apache Spark
  - Presentation by Abhi on Spark
  - Can do a cluster setup at OCF
  - Want to make it available not just to OCF, but also outside
  - Tricky to set up in cluster
    - Difficult issues when dealing with untrusted users
    - Definitely need to put workers in VMs
  - Sanjay is very familiar with Spark, might have advice
  - Want to set up VMs on desktops, puppet the entire thing
  - If interested, contact Abhi

- Next time
  - Chris to give a presentation on puppet
  - Discuss more about building computers

Meeting ended at 7:00pm
