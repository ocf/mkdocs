- Introductions
  - What did people learn about UNIX?
    - More use of standard tools
    - rm -rf / actually works on Solaris
      - live demo: not on supernova
    - Virtualization (Xen)
- Updates
  - Chris and Nick still to meet with B&G on Thursday to relay BoD
    consensus on use of space
  - Chris met with ASUC Mobile App team to discuss OCF hosting of mobile
    app
	- They don't really need anything special, will put them on biohazard
  - Backups
    - Now sort of exist (i.e. there is at least one backup)
    - "Off-site" under SM's mattress
      - Padding in case of earthquakes
      - Probably good enough; if all of Berkeley goes away, no point in
        having backups anyway
    - Possibility of Amazon S3
      - Estimates for 2000 GB
        - Full redundancy: $60/m
        - Reduced redundancy: $50/m
        - Glacier: basically impossible for daily backups of all data
          - Fee to delete data early, so we'd have to store tons of TB
          - Retreiving all 2000GB even over 24 hours costs ~$600
            - Over 4 hours: ~$4000
      - Difficult to pay for things monthly anyway, especially over
        the summer
    - Chris to write draft of backup plan, get feedback
- Discussion of building computers
  - Staff computer: need something that can handle 3 monitors
    - Budget of $1,000 or so; try to come up with a build to compare
      next meeting <http://pcpartpicker.com/>
  - Also building other computers (about 6 need to be replace in lab)
    - Pros
      - More computers built; more staff get to be involved
      - Choose exactly the hardware we want
        - Useful for graphics cards with Linux compatibility
      - Fun staff activity?
      - Could save some money, much easier to purchase (vs BearBuy)
      - Easier to upgrade in the future, if we want to
    - Cons
      - Probably won't save much money
      - Harder to replace things when they fail
        - (although only hard drives seem to fail frequently)
        - Can make a spreadsheet of SNs and warranty info
      - Might be hard to find good cases
    - For reference, the new Dell computers were ~$820 each
      - (and had unnecessary i7's)
- Improvements to staff hours / meeting format
  - Work on todo/projects queue during staff hours
  - Figure out teams to tackle things on the queue
    - Definitely good idea, but hard to figure out how
    - Easier now that more people have permissions
  - Anonymously contact Chris/Nick somehow with suggestions!
- Next time
  - More discussion of building computers
  - More project discussion
- Good luck on midterms!

Meeting ended at 7:07pm
