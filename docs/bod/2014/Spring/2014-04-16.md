- End of year approaching
  - Need to decide how best to spend our remaining budget
    - Printing supplies
    - Misc lab stuff
    - Big items?
- Replacing desktops in the lab
  - ~8 computers are ~7 years old
  - Suggestion to replace them now while we have money
    - Would prefer to wait until move to Naia Lounge, but not feasible
  - Request to allocate $7,000 as upper bound for purchasing replacement
    - Rough specs: i5 or equivalent, 8GB RAM, integrated graphics
    - Estimated cost: roughly ~$550/computer before tax, shipping,
      warranties, etc.
  - Vote passes unanimously: $7,000 allocated
  - SM and GM will research, select possible models, present findings at
    next BoD meeting
  - Purchasing needs to happen soon (we lose access to funds early May)
- School of Social Welfare project
  - IT director asked for help with hosting for faculty and grad
    students
  - Wants a fairly complicated setup (would require their own user
    accounts, some kind of CMS, ...)
  - Wants us to sign an SLA
  - Figure out the timeline
  - Require reasonable compensation, especially if we sign an SLA
    - OCF funded by student fees, so not unreasonable to ask the
      department to cover hardware costs proportional to their usage
- Saturday events
  - This Saturday!
    - Food afterwards
  - Suggest topics on Google Doc
  - Will follow up later this week with details

Meeting ended at 7:32pm
