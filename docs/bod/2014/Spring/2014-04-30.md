- Last BoD meeting of Spring 2014; no staff hours next or finals week
- Spending remaining ASUC funds
  - Technically $15k left in accounts, but large chunks earmarked for:
    - Cisco switch from IST ($2300)
    - Paper/toner BearBuy purchase ($3500)
    - 8x Dell desktops BearBuy purchase ($7000)
    (amounts are worst-case estimates; we expect to pay slightly less)
  - Discussed at last meeting:
    - Replacing gaming chairs (x2)
      - $500 allocated by BoD
    - Purchasing new scanner (in addition to current, not replacement)
      - $100 allocated by BoD
    - Purchasing new processor for jaws, if sufficient funds
      - Wait until BearBuy purchases clear so we are certain, but should
        have enough even after gaming chairs and scanner
      - $2500 allocated by BoD
  - After purchasing above items, proposal to leave the few remaining
    funds at discretion of GM and SM to clear account for the year
      - Passed unanimously by BoD
- Proposal to add new bylaw reading:
    Ex officio members of the Board, with the exception of elected
    Managers, shall not be included when calculating the necessary
    number of Directors present to reach quorum.
  Passed unanimously by BoD, and amended to official bylaws
- Summer plans
  - Lab is closed over the summer
  - If you're going to be in Berkeley and want card-key, contact ckuehl
- Farewell to our beloved OCF seniors
    Dara Adib <daradib@ocf>
