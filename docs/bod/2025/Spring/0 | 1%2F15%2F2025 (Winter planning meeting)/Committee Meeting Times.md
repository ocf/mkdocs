## Historical context

The purpose of committees was to delegate work from the managers. They were later expanded to have two committee heads per committee to further reduce workload on heads and delegate responsibilities. Committees, however, are meant to have more members than their heads participating, and are a great entry point for new members to learn about OCF operations. 

Some further complaints are that for OCFers who know they want to contribute, or discuss a particular item, they don't know the appropriate location, since the meetings may not be on, the meeting gets cancelled, because of perceived lack of interest. Further, they may not be scheduled at all for that semester.
