Proposal is done, just adding more to context

## Proposal


Make the Board of Directors meeting time 6-7pm on Wednesdays in the lab

Make the General Meeting time 7-8pm on Wednesdays in the lab


### Benefits


1. Members have reported 8-9pm general meetings are too late in the evening, whether due to scheduling or needing to get home, especially late at night. By moving meeting times up, more people would be able to make OCF GM.
2. Having more time for general meetings means more surface area with which to interact with members. Most OCFers only come on Wednesdays and stay until closing. Having more time would increase our ability to integrate new staff, run projects, and have OCF social time.
3. We can go for food more easily after BoD


### Drawbacks


1. As BoD is before GM, we would move BoD up, which may cause schedule conflicts with courses.


#### In address:


1. No committee heads or managers have reported scheduling conflicts with 6-7pm BoD thus far


## Context

In recent history, the OCF has met 7-8pm for the Board of Directors meeting and 8-9pm for the general meeting
