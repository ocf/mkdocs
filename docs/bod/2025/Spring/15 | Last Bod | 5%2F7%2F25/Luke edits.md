Bylaw 16.

At the initial meeting of each Fall and Spring semester, the Board of Directors shall consist of cabinet. This shall be termed the "interim Board of Directors" or "interim BoD".


16\.1 Any other previous Director able and wishing to continue their directorship for that semester shall indicate such intent at the initial meeting. At that point, the interim BoD shall vote to continue such directorships.


16\.2 It is assumed that the interim BoD shall not unreasonably withhold consent for a previous Director to continue their directorship. An example of reasonable grounds to withhold consent is if there are serious reasons that a previous Board member will not be able to fulfill their duties (e.g. due to medical or other concerns).
