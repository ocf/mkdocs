* Opstaff hours issue
  * Jeda: Most Opstaff agree about there not being enough hours
    * Can't provide enough hours because of decal and bod, $80 per week loss
    * Projects do not work because of the administrative overhead
    * Ronit: work from home hours do not qualify for CACSSF (aka project hours)
    * Unable to pay Opstaff the full number of hours: no money :money_with_wings:
    * I saw the [Opstaff Projects](https://docs.ocf.berkeley.edu/doc/opstaff-projects-P6fIiRH3QN) page 
    * Nothing passed b/c funding situation
    * Oliver: change job description for op staff: no guarantee for hours
      * Hiring technical people for opstaff could also benefit the OCF
    * A lot of technical staff are open to fulfill opstaff hours
