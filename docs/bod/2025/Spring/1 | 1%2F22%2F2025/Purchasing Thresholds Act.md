# Purchasing Thresholds Act

\
Allow managers to make purchases without notification to BoD for immediately required purchases, such that each purchase is below $100, and that the total weekly purchase before notifying BoD is $250. 

The expectation remains that large purchases are discussed with bod, and that every effort is made to not make 'large' (e.g. >$40) purchases without passing it through bod. These are for purchases which are regularly approved, and the thresholds are arbitrarily set 

Exceptions to the threshold, up to $1000 in total, excluded from the regular limit of $250

* Paper
* Toner


This is helpful for small purchases which are helpful for regular operations. For example, paper, ~~sporks~~ pens, etc. 


Thresholds are up for debate.

* PR constitution
