# Agenda


Notes on new BOD structure:


1. Itemization Categories

   
   1. Deliberation

      
      1. Items which require discussion and maybe a vote afterwards
   2. Voting

      
      1. Items which need a vote for, but not much discussion. Prefer this for procedural items.
   3. Notification

      
      1. Information provided to the board to keep everyone in the loop
   4. Open Discussion

      
      1. Free for all, unstructured bod time


\
Bod started: 6:12pm


## Deliberation Items


* Joe: Alumni wanted to advertise tech volunteering opp
  * an ocf alumni talked about tech volunteering opportunity
  * non-paid project esp. for mobile phone qapp
  * phd student research with prof
  * if anyone is interested for a lab opportunity talk to Joe
  * for a possible start up in the future
  * can offer credits & LoR??
* ronitnath: deliberate purchasing threshold act
  * usually ocf has small purchases that are trivial
  * sometimes sms need to make emerg purchases
  * formalizes that framework
  * any manager to make purchase less than 100 per item
  * notification at next bod
  * total < 250 $
  * only for emergencies
  * we still want to discuss utility items to avoid bad purchases
  * refer to  [Purchasing Thresholds Act](./1%20%7C%201%252F22%252F2025/Purchasing%20Thresholds%20Act.md)
  * lukepeters: could be phrased more as a common law/precedent based authorization rather than a set threshold
  * tabled
* fengyihuang
  * guest account
  * pushed to open discussion
