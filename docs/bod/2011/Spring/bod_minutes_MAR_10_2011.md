<7:15>BoD begins
<7:16>simplyhd has been converted to a regular user
6 in favor, 3 abstain 
<7:22>myBerkeleyProject, and its implication for the OCF
Shouldn't affect us too much, but we need to sell ourselves to the Senate. Less technically savy users may gravitate, we may need to emphasize our technical services
and concentrate on serving the more informed users. Focus on education not dumbing down our system.
<7:30>Surge group--
Difficulties of the university data center may not be a good idea 
Hearst Feild Annex -> may not get the space
Evans -> ? Possibility, Preferential
Sherryg will push the Evans, since it is minimal in cost and effort.
Daradib send emails to all ex-staff and faculty users to leverage their contacts. Also make a lab survey, to find out what is going on. Logistics may be a bit tricky,
but not be difficult.
<7:40>New Linux machines...some ideas, expansion. LOCK the NEW MACHINES. Buy locks if we don't have any. Can we do it this weekend?
<7:43>Sherryg says don't do anything before we know if we have locks. Money is technically in our account. 5pm investigate the lock situation.
<7:45>Policy on lost&found, a flash stick was stolen from Pubs lost&found
Sanjayk: If we identify the person we should store the item in the server room.
<7:48>Process accounting...Dara explains
Daradib: Store programs, timestamps, and cpu minutes.
<7:49>Phichi, check the name, paperwork should checked

<8:01> Other campus groups
-Boalt.org -> OCF equivalent in the law group
Do the FSF, and ideologically aligned with us. Logisitics are unclear.
Felix: our webserver isn't great, why new responsibility. 
EFF, as close as it gets to our target users. Have technical users, but OCF lack of presence in that area.
