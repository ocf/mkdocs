<7:21>Discussion with kevinm and how it went
<7:22>daradib: Help with consolidation, pros cons
<7:22>Sherryg: Bears initiative, ocf getting kicked out, SURGE where everybody is going to go
<7:23>What we want to push for? Options Evans Hall, Barrows, Field Annex, Data Center
<7:24>Evans->sanjayk says lets see options
<7:25>sherryg: Barrows->small
<7:26>Pushing to move us to a university datacenter. 
<7:28>Sanjayk: Rant about why the datacenter is a bad idea:
-OCF loses its value as a student group and essentially becomes slave labor
-Part of the spirit of the OCF is the ability to manage our own systems and learn from mistakes
-ASUC forgets that we have lives too and we need to keep the OCF's character as a student 
<7:29>Mini-Decal with Jordan
<7:31>Sherryg: Expenditures
Lag time...sherryg wants to pass expenditures early because the ASUC is slow.
Printers HP->Sanjayk is wary, but thinks its ok
HP discount? no real chance.
