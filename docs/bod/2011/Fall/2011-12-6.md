Want to pressure ASUC, but there might not be more options.
-Justify/explain what we will do with given space or more space.

What we have may be the best situation


Opinions:
-If we drop the lab services, we'll never bring it back.
--We've not-had a lab in the past

Have a few people 

Dara: I've seen the 'final' drafts and 

Critical for us to sercure adequate server space, CS dept-Soda, need Someone to pursue 

Not offering a lab, won't be able to offer a lab 1st semester anyway

Issue of BoD resolution to not offer a lab:



Reason to make decision is not that we hate the ASUC, although we feel screwed.  We do not know the space we will have, what our internet connection will be

ASUC is the group the architects are responsible, the ASUC, Office of EVP is the only 

Issue may be that the OCF is not humanized enough, MCC, you can put face(s) to them.

Meeting with EVP with OCF, Roves, Pubs, Blue & Gold


OCF, we provide

Service is judged by uptime, 


Why we need server space:


Student groups that don't have permentant office space, rely on webservices provided by the OCF.  The OCF provides webhosting for some of the smallest


vhost list is minimum list of student groups alone that rely on the OCF for support

other groups not on vhost list - groups accounts, publication, coops, frats, --approved users

*concrete examples of student organizations we prop up web-wise


We were still up during CalMail outage


BoD vote on a message to OCF users:
-The OCF 

--What are the reasons we're closing the lab


/*Include in email

>Motion to shut down lab and printing services in fall of 2012 (reasons enumerated in document), proposed kfang, second sajayjk, unanimous approval all of BoD
Reasons:
-Space limitations 
-Lab 
-Electricity
-Network
-Square footage
-Number of computers
-Economy of scale (overhead of managing computers)
-Disruption of moving, and time to set lab back up

-Focus on providing core services after move: full webhosting
-Uncertainty about move and logistics



SURGE...what it is, why we're moving, that we understand user conerns

(Sympathetic note, bear with us if we experience disruption in service, we understand how seriously our users take uptime at the OCF)

(Call for assistance, if you can talk to your senator, 

Individual user, suggestions for alternate locations for the OCF

We are in contact with the ASUC Executive Vice President in charge of allocating space for SURGE temporary move during Eshleman Hall remodel
