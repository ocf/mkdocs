Motion: re-appoint Michael to BoD:

Motion: paper, toner, maintenance kits, and other purchases for the maintenance and service of our existing printers should be exempt from the 36-hour rule requiring contact of BoD members.


Motion:  Ongoing policy:
Remove the elevated "staff" privileges of any OCF member who is
inactive and does not wish to be active, including any member who has
had these privileges for a few months but is not willing or able to
hold staff hours at least one hour per week, and/or any member with root
privileges who is not willing or able to spend time in general at least
weekly after hours in the lab. This applies to both currently registered
students and alumni.
Intention: remove privileges of people who are not volunteering and helping.
For example: requiring kerberos principle is an elevated privilege 


Amloessb, 2nd kedo: 4 in favor, 3 abstain.


>Current staff - update gdoc staff contact infromation


New proposal for adding pages: allow users to get more pages


New print quota claims : must report issues to pubs staffer to get a page repalcement.
-> Talk to pubs staff - keep paper
→ organization system for pubs staff
-> (write on whiteboard)


In order to better policy printing, at the time of printing errors, pubs staff must be notified and take possession of the pages in question.  OCF staff will reimburse pages misprinted due to hardware (incl. printer) and software (incl. misrendering), (not incl page miscount).  OCF will send an email (do not send us an email) to resolve the issue by email within a week by refunding pages or explaining why pages will not be refunded.
Motion amloessb, 2nd sanjayk, passes unanimously.


First foray into giving students more pages - allow students to get more pages by returning toner cartridges. GM sets up a mechanism by which users can get additional pages by returning a printer cartridge, limit of one user per page,
Dara, 2nd sanjayk, unanimous pas.

As seen in The Daily Cal and Micronet, Box.net will be providing
accounts to UC Berkeley students, faculty, and staff for "cloud-based"
file storage as part of an OE two-year agreement, beginning in spring.
Based on the service's FAQ, it looks like 2 GB of storage per user if
space is equally distributed.


IST CalWeb is service which is similar to OCF web hosting, though it is
limited in most ways and less limited in others (per-user config).


OCF should have training sessions and group socials.


Review project assignments, and have someone in charge of responding to
print quota emails.


Obtain contact info of new staff members.


If time permits:


Discuss drive purchase for hal.
Discuss use of computer lab by group accounts.


Suggest appointing Michael to BoD.

On Tuesday, Stephen Le (sle), an alumni and former site manager, asked
by email if anybody wants to go rock climbing / bouldering at Indian
Rock on Sunday, October 23, late morning to early afternoon?


On Wednesday, we replaced both printers' toners with HP-brand toner and
applied HP maintenance kits. Deforestation is still printing white
vertical lines and has been turned off. It has been fairly extensively
cleaned.


Proposed decisions:








Printing cost estimate:


Each expected page costs us $0.007 from paper and $0.013 from toner for
$0.02 total not including the cost of the printer ($2,800) and
maintenance kits ($340). A conservative total estimate is $0.03/page.


85,000 pages over 6 weeks is about 14,000 pages/week rounded up to
about $300/week not including printers and maintenance kits. At 16-17
weeks per semester, for two semesters our printing costs should be
roughly $10,000 not including cost of printers and maintenance kits.
And making many assumptions, like 24,000 real pages/toner, etc. And if
we are open during summer costs may increase, but hopefully not
dramatically because demand is less.
