Minutes from the GM:

On Nov 12, contacted about setting up a blog for a co-op, which brings
the question up if co-ops are eligible for OCF group accounts, and if
so, who would be authorized to request an account and reset the
account's password later on.

On Nov 15, discovered Panasonic electric stapler in Room 18 ("the
Caliber room but not really"). According to the Publications Center
roves it belongs to them and we can use. It is at the front desk.

On Nov 16, updated Flash player on the Debian machines. Also
latest Eclipse is provided locally.

No updates about Surge, campus contact is deferring updates to next
week. ASUC leadership should have toured locations this afternoon. Will
meet with other Surge stakeholders on Dec 5.

As mentioned at last meeting, we have obtained a mapping of SIDs to
CalNet UIDs of individual accounts approved after Fall 1995. With a
public anonymous LDAP bind we can get information on and reset passwords
online for people who can use CalNet (current students, faculty, staff,
and affiliates with a grace period).

Sanjay will generate some visually-appealing statistics based on
the front desk clicker (how many people came in to lab) and headcount
(how many people in lab) data from Spring 2010 to present.

Kenny will report on the efforts to fix printer deforestation.

Aaron will report on the efforts to "fix" Windows desktops.

OCF should have training sessions and group socials.
