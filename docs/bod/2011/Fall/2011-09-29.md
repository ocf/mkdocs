Migration: LDAP, Kerberos - sanjay lead, loren help


GM Report:
OCF operational as of Monday, because 1 HD failed, RAID degradation to minimum. Everything taken offline to preserve last copy of data, as backups had previously (recently) failed.
>Need to set up backups. On new machine.  Buy SATA or SAS HDs for backups. 2 backup disks.


Active servers: mudslide (with mon, reportTracker) and tornado. Old/broken machines moving out. 
Server room & lab space cleaned, E-waste from server room


ASUC audited us,
Wednesday 9-28-11, 3:00 PM                (Dara notified by email, night before)
Record for Disk Array and Disk Array HDs, 8 Dell monitors: (2 accounted for, 4 in lab, and 2 missing)


Printer issues: 
Leaking toner cartridges, new supplier Staples, Re-manufactured toner $70 vs $300 per cartridges, x5 printing costs if updated.


GM delegates Loren secretary


epidemic (disk array) can fit more drives, should buy hard drives.
Prices: 2 TB for $210, 1 TB for $105 (SATA). For HAL: SAS 400 GB for $400. 4.9 TB alloc'd for RAID. Move to RAID 10.


pollution drives, in machine when it failed: 2x2TB SATA, 4x400GB SAS, 1x2TB SATA-spare, 1x400GB SAS-spare


For the record: ejc.berkeley.edu, also has esc.berkeley.edu -- Eng Student Council


Group accounts should not have printing quotas. Not the service we exist to provide. Why now: Proposing because we have an explosion of new accounts, printing and new users in the lab. User page limit-250 page significant budget difference. 20% our additional cost for recycled paper.
Official toner much more expensive


No more saved homefolders on linux desktops, to speed up NFS
Printing:
Staples gives $2 in-store credit for recycling toner.  Users have asked us how to additional pages. Want to bring in library users, not copy center scale print jobs. If users start paying for printing, will be more aggressive => NOT GOING TO SELL PAGES.  
Ways to get more pages? Have users get receipt from Staples toner cartridges.  
-You get 250 pages advertised, and you get 25 pages to cover for errors. 275 in quota
> Need guidelines on printing, giving pages back, etc. -- posted online
> We need more meta-information about printing errors. Pages given back, etc


> Need consolidated place for policy, need to be transparent.


Trivia:
We host a Debian mirror: debian.ocf.berkeley.edu/
mirrors.kernel.org topographically close to us, but down (frequently?/no longer in use)
Student Regent is in Berkeley
Online approve 1000 new users in ~3 months, normally 1500 new users per 1 year
RAID arrays do not support intermixing of standard and enterprise drives
All our servers are slower than desktops
Can now logon to many linux desktops at once.
Sun ULTRA 450 (Disk Array) - Keep as table/fridge ?
