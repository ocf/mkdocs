*Everyone is dressed in their spriffy OCF t-shirts*

sahnn: I dried my shirt with a hair dryer after washing it in the sink.

Call to order 7:14PM

akit: welcome to the BoD of the semester

GM:

- budget

akit: budget is at $4001.91, it should be more as we are getting a refund

- what do we do with the rest of the money?

akit: so what do we do with the rest of the money? we can put it into
paper/toner
yury: we can buy a little more toner and paper than we need, and then put
the money into things we've 

approved this semester but haven't bought (ups, banner)

(there is then talk about how akit and sahnn are wearing the same sandals)

- photo mosaic
thomson: i need photos to make a bigger photo mosaic
(http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~thomson/ocf/)

- banquet 
akit: come on May 5, 2007

- possible party at frank's
frank: yeah, it might happen, check irc/facebook

SM:

- docs
elliot: if you've ever done anything around here (thanks for that, btw), if
you could write down parting 

thoughts, documentation, etc. 
yury: we need to draw attention to this, as it is important 
aaron: add your docs to the staffwiki 
yury: it won't get updated
sluo: this is why we need to have a decal on wikis

- dwc
yury: so dwc has refused to perform his `duties' in that anyone who is
maintaining the irc server should 

also take care of drought and sns issues. sns e-mails us with warnings about
possible hacking activity, 

and 99% of the time it's just the irc server.
sluo: if someone needs to take responsibility for maintaining drought,
there's a lot that needs to be 

done. 
yury: if someone wants to do it, volunteer.
jchu: well, i could do it after finals
yury: good! you're it

- Project Groups:
	WebDev (cardi):
		cardi: ...
	Website (gordeon/jchu):
		gordeon: someone needs to check the file uploader 
		akit: wasn't it supposed to be dmchan
		jchu: yeah
		gordeon: anyway, someone check it
		yury: i will
	Gaming (geo):
		geo: burning crusade up!
	OCFDev (frank):
		frank: oh, I put faq signs on all the machines 
	LDAP (sluo):
		sluo: replication's up

elliot: i'd just like to thank aoaks, thomson, maymei, and frank for their
services
akit: horray for graduating seniors!

(clap clap)
