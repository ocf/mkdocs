How about we just have another run off election?

sluo: It's clear that no one wants the job.

<edited>

yury: This is the thing that just lost the hdd and stole from ocf right?

yury: jchu can do sm agenda

jchu: I defer to sluo

sluo: sm agenda
only thing to note is that we have issues.
We have issues with firewalls on solaris box
tentative update to ipfilters 20th

sle: Backup your data on friday

yury: Did we put up a notice?

sluo: Not yet since I decided an hour ago

yury to jchu: Put up a notice

jchu: ok

card: What happened?

sluo: We had multiple nfs meltdowns over the week

cardi: So we're fixing stuff?

yury: sle wants to put the gigabit 3550
built in firewall
connect to asuc
does firewall and security

sluo: That is not acceptable to campus security

yury: We also have NAT and that's not acceptable

sluo: There is nothing in campus policy agains a NAT 

<edited>

yury: We can run another rulesset
bind it to another interface
we will still have a firewall up just on different interface
it would protect us from asuc at one point

sluo: jchu will think about it

jchu: okay..

sluo: Is that it. Anyone have any agenda items?

yury: Two items

sluo: oh.. account issues

<refer to emails>

yury: First one sounds reasonable... second one no

sluo: Before we close we need to do bod election, someone remind us

yury: Okay

sluo: Damnit where is it?

yury motion to change jchu's shell to rsh

jchu: why

yury: Restricted shell just in case

jchu; I should probably change my password to something more secure

yury: I also need to get you pda so you don't forget your password

sle: I memorized them

yury: I can't memorize tier 2

sluo: So from Daniel Armor(???)... 4th year undergraduate (Greek thing)

<refer to his email>

yury: sluo either you or I will make executive summary
In general all frats have requirement to educate self on alcohol
and sexual violence. They want a general website on ocf
ocf doesn't give accounts to nonofficial student groups

sluo: Question and answers? Debate?

jchu: Are they organized?

yury: Seems like loosely grouped (i.e. refugees)
seems beneficial to campus

mkendall motions to give them account
yury seconds

sluo: Anyone have anything else to say?

sluo: Those in favor of granting account
6 in favor
1 against (jchu)

13 present

motion fails

sluo: More abstentions than yes votes...

yury motions again
mkendall seconds

yury: If you have something to say against it say it..

jchu: I want them to be more organized

yury: We can demand they have a responsible party. That's ocf policy.
If that person doesn't check their email within 48 hours...

sluo: All in favor
8 in favor
0 against

motion passes

yury: akit isn't here but we still meet the minimum.

sluo: Barely...

<yury talk here about asuc committee accounts>

sluo: It would be unwise to anger asuc

yury: The question then becomes...
What if there is a bogus committee on asuc with 1 person?

<edited>
"oh... i want a group account and virtual host name@berkeley"

sluo: We have power to refuse the account

yury: Yesk, but refusing the account after creation causes problems
as with jsrc(???)

It leads to a lot of teeth grinding

<edited>

yury: We should do this before the fact

sluo agrees
We should figure out exactly how asuc is structured

yury: Until then we should allow any accounts with office of president

sluo: anyhow... that can be dealt with later

sluo: anna fuller wants ocf account for coop
coops are not osl or reshall

mkendall: What does she want it for?

sluo: I know there are some coop ethernet managers

yury: Maybe she wants a shell account...

sluo: She wants webspace that she doesn't have to administer

mkendall: To pass it on

sluo: Are we approving it?

yury: It serves a small portion of the Berkeley community...
kind of shady

sluo: I think it's funny all frats are OSL sponsored

mkendall:  Frats are also for profit and coops aren't

yury: Wait osl can be for profit?

sluo: Frats are special...

yury: You need a faculty sponsor

sluo: Uou don't need a faculty sponsor for student groups...
you just need 4 students

akit walks in with pizza

akit tells him to back away

yury reads the agenda
