Budget: $15,490.20
 	- approximately $2000 for new emergency power supply

Angel: is there any way to make the windows machines faster?
 	sluo:
 		- gateways 7 years old and need replacing
 		- dells are from 2000/2003, about 5 years old and could 
also use replacing
 		- supernova needs replacing
 		- we should join the rest of the world in samba 3

 	Angel: what would we do with the old computers?
 	yury: could move them into Eshelman

should we start moving to eshelman?
 	yury: I would prefer having a nice power infrastructure in 
Eshelman before we start moving the machines in

MAIL
 	sluo: our mail server is on a very old machine, but we have a very 
nice server donated by Sun that we should put into use

LDAP
 	sluo:
 		- NIS+ is responsible for storing user info		- 
This is kind of supported by Sun but will not be in future Solaris release
 	yury: one solution is to use Kerboros, but Windows doesn't work 
well with it
 		- Kerberos is waiting on Samba 4
 		- wjm: our sendmail is so ridiculously complicated that 
only dwc has mastered it
 		- sluo: actually, luns, dwc and ??? all understand parts 
of it, no one understands all of it

delegate keys afterwards

yury volunteers to spearhead transition to headcrash

Dima received his second takedown notice for downloading illegally and 
hogged diskspace
 	- Is temporarily sorried (disabled)
 	- Requested to get his mail forwarded

 	yury: I think we should forward his mail, keep his account 
disabled for a period and then re-enable
 	As it stands, his account will not be enabled without BoD approval

MOTION: forward dima's mail
 	motion by yury
 	seconded by sluo
 	yea: 12
 	nay: 2
 	passes

 	yury: in favor of re-enabling eventually
 	sluo: i think it's unacceptable [to keep downloading illegally and 
abuse resources] and we need to send that message, so keep it disabled
 	yury: i think strip him of priviliges, disable temporarily, make 
sure he can't do it again, give him another chance
 		- would it have a positive effect, or just be destructive?
 	sluo:
 		- disabling will have positive effect on us
 		- positive effect on campus
 	jkit:
 		- disable for at least four weeks
 		- in that time think about it and revisit the issue to 
decide what to do

MOTION: table the issue of dima's punishment
 	yea: 14
 	nay: 2
 	passes

Eating of pizza commences

elliot has entered the room.
