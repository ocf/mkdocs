yury: It's 7:13 we can't start yet
akit: omg
The budget is whatever it is last week minus the office depot:
10 box paper
1000 paper clips
and stapler
The stapler is in the draw with staples

yury: Didn't we have a locked down stapler before?  
akit: That one jammed a lot

We want to get lenovo computers $578.89 per computer
We're going to try to not have to pay tax since we are a nonprofit group
The tax is $41.86 per computer

yury motion for $550 per machine for 8 machines

akit: Is it free shipping sle?

sle: It says so

yury: I would like to stick to the $500 max from last semester

sluo: I say we should motion for full price and if we get tax off it's a bonus 

yury: $40 x 8 is like another machine

sluo: No

yury: It's like half a machine
We can spend the money on licenses or something

akit: Don't we have hardware failure and can't wait?

yury: We can replace the parts 

sluo: We don't have enough motherboards 

yury: Fine $600 per machine

akit: Second?

mkendall seconds

akit: All in favor?

Only mkendall is against

yury: Who's taking minutes?
Do we have quorom?

13 BOD members present

akit: We're geting 15 licenses of MS Office
Professional Plus and we want to get Windows server?

yury: Huh?

sle: We can only make one MS purchase per year
It's 1 year from date of purchase
The software will be covered by software assurance,
We can get free upgrade within 2 years

Cost:
$140 for windows server, terminal server, 
CALS $6-10 per seat

yury: If we can terminal server, we should get vista on the Lenovos, so we can use it right away

sle: Uhhh why?
We can just run services

akit: Do you guys need more time to decide?
Figure it out by next week

nov 4 angel island

sle: How are we going there?

akit: BART 
I have no idea where angel island is?

stevklaw: In the middle of the bay

akit: We are going to have a wii party/potluck.
We should have another thanksgiving dinner
We can either have a potluck or Chicken n Waffles

Secret Santa
We put everyones name in hat, then you get time
to figure out what to get that person 
or we can do a white elephant gift exchange

abhi walks in

akit: There will be a maximum and minimum price
geo are you going to do the sm agenda?

geo: I'm not sm

sluo: You've been designated sm and since you've been sitting up front and eating our food...  

geo: One of the concerns is that we need LDAP tools
R.A.P.E.S. = Review Accounts Pending Email Script
It will replace add'em all and email'em all
I need more information from LDAP team

yury: You got anything done?

geo: No

akit: Someone needs to create accounts

yury: jchu 

gordeon: I will

yury: He can create accounts?

gordeon: Yes

akit: How's the window login process?

geo: sue?

yury: We can just add printers on the server and expose those to clients
They would just have to choose one of the printers which will control how many pages are printed, front/back etc.

sluo: If we want to run XP and Vista at same time we need to enable folder redirection by default

yury: Someone needs to do it

geo: sue?

gordeon: I don't want to do it

akit: Why dont you do it yury?

yury: Out of principle
I'm really upset with people's desire to help

akit: You're not helping

yury: I fixed microup <???>

akit: You're not helping users

sle: I'll remove you from staff

yury: So we'll remove people from staff who don't show up to hours
How about we remove sluo who has missed 3 staff hours without cancelling

sluo: Fine with me

akit: Project groups?

project sheet handed around
sluo motions to cardi

cardi: Oh?
So jchu believes there is reasonable doubt that yury didn't download the files
So the idea is, so we're going to bring up evidence again and if we get enough votes on bod, then we overrule jchu 

yury: I believe it's GM decision first

cardi: So if it's overruled, the policy would be in effect and applied to yury

yury: I think it goes to GM first, to think if jchu made a mistake

sluo: It's dmp, there is no formal appeals policy

yury: I'm frankly tired of this

sluo: So are the rest of us

cardi: quick recap
So jchu writes a really long essay

abhi: Does it have a thesis?

cardi: Yea it does
So it's like a long law thing.

read jchu's email for his response

cardi: So yeah... the copyrighted files were on the disk and could have been recovered...and I'm not really sure what to say...

sluo: Some of the evidence is very large bandwidth spike around 10:30-11:30 PM oct 6 coming from the linux machines
Process viewing shows rsget/rsfetch running.
It is know that yury used those to download Battlestar Galatica before

sluo explains captcha

sluo: We saw the captcha cracker running
We see files downloading
Evidence from file system that files were downloaded, reassembled and encrypted
There was a links file, historically used by the autodownload script as list of destination URLs to download
The URLs point to Battlestar Galatica links on rapidshare

sle: Thefiles were named e10, e11, e12 and were 350 MB in size, which is about normal size of downloaded tv show
The naming scheme suggests episodes

akit: Did you bring the evidence?

sluo: No... but if you want it, you can ask

cardi: So a few weeks ago at a general meeting we established a policy just in case this happened
We don't police our users
It's not out intention to be enforcers of copyright law, however we need to play by the rules.
The argument was made that digital copyright is not valid in court, though we should play it on the safe side

sluo: The fundamentals of copyright are clear
It is mostly the procedure of obtaining evidence in digital copyright cases that
is unclear and how to proescute people who violate it

cardi: Why would we vote for policy if we don't enforce it?

akit: Did we put it into bylaws and send it to users?

sluo; No... but we have right to change policy at anytime

akit: What now?

cardi: So the SM chose to make decision and didn't follow procedure

yury: I think he did follow procedure.
Are you questioning his procedure or his decision?

cardi: You're questioning semantics again

sluo: We are questioning the decisionn

akit: So what happens if we overrule the SM?

sluo; It is a warning for yury

akit: We're going to do timelimits on debate

cardi to sluo: Do you want to present the evidence?
stevklaw wants to see it

sluo: Yea

yury to stevklaw: Do you think it's important?

akit: yury's turn to talk

yury: I will wait

stevklaw: I will wait to see the evidence

yury: This isn't about me getting a warning or not, it's about where OCF is going with the policy, it's about use chasing users.
The evidence is all circumstantial
There are not good grounds for the case 
There is reasonable doubt that I did anything illegal

I don't want to accuse anyone of being a facist but you guys are trying to push through a law and make up definitions as you go.

yury elegant rant about legal system

akit; Rebuttal?

sluo: Yes the evidence is circumstatinal but it is still evidence.
There are links between the evidence

sluo reiterate arguments

akit: Are we actively looking for users?

sluo: No...

yury: That's funny... sluo, since you have a list of users who may be violating policy in your home directory

sluo: The users were noticed when we reenabled quotas.
We are not searching for them

yury: The evidence is not strong against me and SM thought so as well 
They could have been anime for all you know
You're accusing me of specific files

stevklaw: What would you say is not circumstanial evidence

yury: Some people think all evidence is circumstantial
If they have a snapshot of rsget grabbing the actual link or having the actual files .
They have no direct proof of what those files are, they're making an assumption

sle: I can respond to that, we have given him numerous chance to prove otherwise like decrypt the files, but he refused
We have filesystem metadata that shows that there was a Battlestar Galatica episode AVI file that was deleted.

yury: When?

sle: Approximatedly the same times that the other evidence happened
We can have root staffers confirm evidence

yury: I'm a root staff, I haven't seen the evidence

sle/yury argue

yury: I asked for the evidence
yury to sluo: Did I request it?

sluo: Not at the time

pizza arrives
sle/yury argue

akit: What do you have to say mkendall?

<mkendall is playing FF3 on his DS>
mkendall: I need to figure out what jobs to assign my characters
I'll have a black mage, a red mage and white mage
pretty standard

akit: Any other comments?

kevintra: BOD can overrule SM?

yury explains semantics of ocf

yury: Our faculty advisor, Brian Harvey, has been sorried for a while. He had a weak password

<lots of random discussions>

yury: We gave a lot of people root recently

mkendall: I didn't get root

yury: You're not 'a lot of people'

mkendall: You're right... if I got root I would just copy porn to all your home directories...

akit: geo how do you feel?

<geo is in front of the pizza>
geo: I feel great...

akit: Vote at 8

mkendall: guys... my black mage is really cute

sluo motions to overturn jchu's decision to not issue yury warning in this incident

yury: Can we make it more explicit?

sluo: 
A yes vote is to over turn decision and give yury warning
A no vote is to not overturn decision and not give yury warning

sle seconds

dmchan: Can I get the title of Evil Head of Human Resources?

sluo: He wants the title with no responsibilities

akit: sure...

7 yes
4 no

<motion passes?>

yury gets first warning

yury: I am also leaving staff and BOD at this point
I will put it in writing
I think OCF has lost its way

akit: With that, who wants to be on BOD?
abhi want to be on BOD?

abhi: sure?

sluo motion is to add abhi and dritch, remove yury

8 in favor
2 against, mkendall + someone else

mkendall: abhi is a wild character

sluo motion to remove mkendall from bod

geo motion to adjourn
sluo second

Meeting adjourned sometime between 8:00 and 8:10 PM
