GM AGENDA

MOTION
- sluo: I move to appoint everyone in this room to BoD and give discretion to ... appoint or remove if necessary(?)
yea: 13
passes

Current Budget: 15,171.96
- akit said wrong budget last week

Microsoft Licenses
- takes about a week to see if we qualify for non-profit
- $59.99 for '07 license key, $28.13 for '03 media kit (?)
- we need to get both

geo says something about jvarga

Paper
- sle: 1.7 cents per page for paper and toner (not including maintenance kit)
- yury: 
	- 70,000 pages so far this semester
	- about 130-200 thousand per semester
- sle: 
	- we use about 1 toner every 8-10 days
reducing toner usage:
- yury: we have a crude way to estimate percent coverage per print job
	- we can track usage, but do we want to?
	- currently we advertise as "250 pages"
	- should we reject/invert print jobs that use a lot of ink?
- sluo: there's nothing much we can do for the fall semester
	- we can look at how much is used for the fall semester and set a rough base for the spring
- yury: 5% coverage is considered standard
	- we can start filtering right now and stop people from printing really black slides
	- invert for them or not print for them
	- but what if it messes up?
	- we will have a testing period, but still
- elliot: we can also measure the number of problem pages before we implement it
- yury: what if someone wants to use their entire 250 pages on black slides
- sluo: i suggest we enable logging of the data and come back later after having thought of possible solutions and with hard numbers

Maintenance Day
- previous day cancelled due to low attendance
- suggested new date: Saturday, Oct 6
- akit will send out email polling for dates people can make

Transformers movie night?
Angel Island trip - further information TBD

This guy came in and he's an RA
- a bunch of RAs came in to organize this huge "bearhunt" in SF
- wants a website ~adh
- he's not OSL registered but wants a group account (so they can get vhosting)
- don't the reshalls have their own association?
- sluo: they're not really a department, nor do they... (something I didn't catch)-

MOTION
yury: motion to give them a group account 
yea: 10
nay: 0

MOTION
sluo: motion to add gordeon to BoD
yea: 10
nay: 1


SM AGENDA

New PCs for island
- quotes from Lenovo, Dell
- dell is around $700-- we can get two kinds
	- $656 w/ monitor
	- $725 w/o monitor
- Lenovo
- sle thinks we can haggle and get a better deal
- we're still looking into it

This means need to fundraise.
- milki says we are really short on money for computers, if this is the price we're looking at
- yury: this is outside of the budget we "allocated"
- sle: Build Your Own (BYO) systems don't have warranty and no OS licenses
- wjm: the Fry's deals still stand-- $250 with $100 rebate
	- we could add enough RAM to make these decent
- akit: I'd rather we pay more and get ones that last longer
- sluo: some have greater power consumption than others-- ask ASUC for support for "going green"
	- a "haha just kidding" solution, says sluo
- cardi: might we be able to get academic versions of software like MatLAB, Labview?
- yury: I really think we should get video cards good enough for running vista
	- it's a shame to have vista licenses go to waste
	- about $50 for 256 mb cards a year ago, now it's probably cheaper
- cardi: when buying these machines do we have to think about supporting publishing programs, etc.
- yury: it was removed from the final MOU, so we don't need to

Quotas
- yury: a lot of our users have excessive quotas, i.e. dwc
	- dwc has given an explanation for having 1.5 gb mail(?) quota
	- among other users
	- dwc has a 3.5 gb home quota
	- i suggest we drop people's quotas back down to normal, except for the people who raised exceptions
- sluo: explanation for dwc's quota is that he gets postmaster mail - several gb per day
	- it's easiest to manage if the quotas are high, and there hasn't really been abuse
	- i see no reason to take it away
- yury: i've told him alternatives
	- (i didn't catch what these alternatives were)
	- dwc says he's willing to do this if asked to do so
- lower mail quotas back down to...?
- we'll get a list of the people and look over 
- dwc can keep his mail quota until SM tells him to do otherwise

HOZING
- suggestions for a copyright policy
	- written by sahnn, sluo, wjm, and whoever else happened to be in the lab
- yury: I don't feel I've had adequate time to look this over
- yury: problem with the part about acknowledging in writing that they received the warning
- different options proposed (1) and (2)
- yury: what if someone is out of the country, etc. and can't come in person
	- would like to reword it

willis enters the room

MOTION
- elliot: motion for 30 seconds of silence and deep breathing
passes

Discussion
- wjm: his reasons for writing option (2):
	- a person may be torrenting very little and someone just happens to see them
	- whereas others may be torrenting a lot more, which doesn't seem fair
- sluo: the amount of hozing itself is not that relevant
	- it's about the illegality of the action, which still stands, not the degree of hozing resources
- sluo: the weeklong grace period is to fit in with the amount of time DMCA allows 
	- account for "propagation delay" of relaying messages between DMCA, campus, and the OCF
- yury: user should be allowed to explain his/her actions
	- problem with 2nd paragraph - "beyond reasonable doubt"
	- change to something like "if the user has had a chance to explain his/her actions and it is demonstrated beyond...."
- sluo: reasonable doubt is mirroring actual legal wording meaning that any reasonable person would come to that conclusion
- sluo: user will always have a chance to explain

Options (1) or (2)
- Deals with situations when a staffer knows you have stuff that may be illegal, although there has not been a takedown notice
- yury: are staffers obligated to send a warning every time they see it?
	- this is too much trouble
	- i don't think it is a big enough problem
	- we should not pursue it this actively
- sluo: (explaning for willis)
	- right now we have no policy for this
	- this goes into policy and is not a constitutional amendment
- yury: I dont' think we should be hunting people down
	- this isn't the the spirit in which OCF has been working
- sluo: I have no qualms about applying this policy to stuff that I noticed
- yury: I don't think we should treat it as a DMCA notice
- sluo: from a legal/moral perspective the only difference from getting a takedown notice is that "they" (the DMCA) haven't noticed yet
- elliot: i like the idea of reserving the right to take action
- yury: i don't think we should treat it on the same level as an actual DMCA takedown
	- we shouldn't be trying to catch users
- kloh: if we've already told them once, shouldn't they know not to do it again?
- mkendall: would like to remove word "store" in the first line
- dmchan: aaron and thomson say hi
- sahnn: let's decide which parts we agree on, which parts we need to debate more, and decide
- yury: consideration of partially denying services
	- if we disable their account they will never get the notice
	- this is kind of... "not nice"
- akit: decide on hozing next week?
- sluo: i'd like to get this done as soon as possible, during this general meeting
- sluo: move to vote would require choosing either (1) or (2) (or another option)

1st amendment:
- sluo: a footnote about clarifying "reasonable doubt" that he will email later

2nd amendment:
- sluo: change wording of "files" to "actions"
- wjm: let's say you're hozing, will probably be greater than 3 mb... something that is lost on me
- yury: is storing files in RAM illegal?
- sluo: files may or may not be infringing depending on who possesses them
	- but whether an action is infringing is well-defined

MOTION
yury: motion to table
yea: 2
nay: 3
motion fails

the footnote about clarifying "beyond reasonable doubt" went through

- yury: want to push to next week
- sluo: can we get a resolution on "actions"
	- the action that prompted the takedown notice or the action you are aware of that may be illegal

straw poll (non-exclusive)
- accepting it with the two amendments and (1): 3
- accepting with the amendments and (2): 3
- neither one: 1

MOTION
another motion to table:
yea:3
nay:6
motion fails

MOTION
motion to give 15 minutes to come up with an alternative option to (1) and (2)
yea: 10
nay: 1
passes

Meeting resumes.

- yury: 
	- for the sake of helping users rather than hurting them
	- and for the sake of easing administrative tasks
	- propose that rather than forcing deactivation of account, it will be left to the discretion of the SM
- sluo: yury's proposal different from (2) because you could receive continuing takedown notices depending on SM whereas in (2) you can get permanently disabled (i didn't understand what he meant there)
- mkendall: I think what yury is saying is the same as (2)
- yury: first time will not count as same as takedown notice (no official warning), second time is at SM discretion
- geo: I propose a Wall of Shame

sluo requests amendment to (2)
- to add the DMP (decision-making process) and remove last sentence about majority of root staffers
- wjm: not friendly to the amendment to (2)
	- How do you do it if not with a majority? Do you want it as a separate option?
- sluo: never mind

- yury: about (3) - user will not be treated as having received a takedown notice at the first offense.
	- just an informal notice, not a formal warning
- wjm: straw poll - do we agree on the first three paragraphs?
	yea: 11
	nay: 0

MOTION
- yury: motion to strike the first option
motion is not seconded

yury: (3) replaces governing body with SM, first offense cannot be treated as takedown notice

straw poll-- runoff will go to official vote: which options do you feel comfortable with? (non-exclusive)
(1):6 
(2):10
(3):5

MOTION
Official vote between (1), (2), and none of the above
(1): 1
(2): 7
none of the above: 1
abstain: 4 (9 out of 13 on BoD have voted)

(2) wins.

Consequences for Dima
sluo: would like to apply new policy to dima (counting his past offenses)
do we continue to forward dima's email at all, time-limited, not at all?

MOTION
- sluo: motion to leave disabled permanently
seconded

MOTION
- mike: reenable at christmas

MOTION
- yury: motion to apply this policy to dima (without counting past offenses)
seconded

- sahnn: should we be applying this retroactively?
	- this is not how US laws work
- sluo: however, he is violating laws and campus policy
	- that what dima was doing was illegal is not disputed
	- therefore the problem of retroactive action is not relevant
- yury: we have never done this in the past, so if we start now we should follow the policy
- elliot: last time i talked to dima, he's done with ocf and doesn't care
	- just wants his mail forwarded for a short time

We have three motions on the table:
1) sluo's motion to permanently disable account
2) mike's motion to reenable at christmas
3) yury's motion to forward his mail until an SM decides is no longer appropriate

(1) disable permanently:
yea: 4
nay: 1
most peopel abstain, motion fails

(2) reenable at christmas:
yea: 3
nay: 7
motion fails

(3) forward mail:

forward for 1 month and then done:

straw poll-- forward mail
yea: 3
nay: 1

limit time to end of semester
yea: 6
nay: 0

wjm: motion to extend dima's mail forwarding until end of semester
yea: 10
nay: 0
passes

Meeting closes at 9:33(!) pm
