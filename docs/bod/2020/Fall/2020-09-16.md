## Discussion

### Summary of Friday's opstaff meeting
- Opstaff projects are coming along, no huge updates yet, but for the most part everyone has stuff to work on
- > Another meeting this Friday, see calendar.

### Updates from internalcomm and commcomm
- Starting up interest groups
    - Need to send out emails to people based on group preferences we identified
- Staff meetings
    - The next staff meeting (topics: Ceph, PR process, Jenkins) will be the last one where we have pre-made slides, so following meetings will require a bit more effort.
    - We've heard from webgroup, but other interest groups can and should hijack the meeting and get people excited about your group.
    - [Nint wrote up some other possible improvements to staff meeting](https://notes.ocf.berkeley.edu/TnniLBnHTeqryXWJvvxJVQ).
    - > Add your comments and ideas.
    - > Unless someone has better ideas, staff meeting will become webgroup meeting.
- We [identified some orgs](https://notes.ocf.berkeley.edu/w7qWFPEHTH-mDiJTbE26ug) that we can reach out to, get them to use our infra, and probably good to open relationships with them in general
    - Next step is probably to create template emails to send to them.

### Updates from universityaffairscomm
- Working on getting emergency keycard access
    - Need to draft up an email to Bahar explaining why
    - > dphan will do this.
- Scheduled time for lab maintenance on Sunday (jaw)
    - If there's anything we should take care of while jaw has access, speak now
    - Fill in this sheet so I know what to get: https://notes.ocf.berkeley.edu/-Xkjz3gIRxmM6ixypTK7iw?edit

### Hack Day Logistics
- Largely handled by wqnguyen!
- > 3p-7p hacking
- > 7p-8p vibing
- > 8p-10p games
- https://github.com/ocf/internalcomm/issues/3
- What prizes should we give out?
    - Lowest effort prizes are gift cards.
    - We could also just buy anything on Amazon and have it ship directly to the winner.
    - > 3 prizes.
    - > ~$100 Pool Fund.
    - > Stuffed penguins. 
    - > Among us - Steam.
        - > This could just be a subsidy for everyone who wants to play
    - > Raspberry pi.
    - > Minecraft.
- Are there any other considerations before it kicks off?
- > nyal should make small issues for people to work on before the event.


### Finances
- https://ocf.io/buysheet
    - There's a bunch of approved purchases from last semester worth a lot of money
    - Few mistakes in buysheet
        - Stickers imply $60 * 78 quantity purchase = $4680! That's more than misc funds!
    - > We should start buying the hardware at some point.
    - > https://github.com/ocf/bod/issues/19
- We need to be spending more STF money. How do we do this?
