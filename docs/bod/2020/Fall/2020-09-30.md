#### Updates from universityaffairs
* Eleanor is gonna run a door access audit to make sure people can't get into the lab when they shouldn't
* She will also request access logs from UCPD on behalf of us since it's faster for her to do it
* Do we need a regular scheduled time for maintenance? (Eleanor asks since she wants to schedule professional staff to be available when we need)

#### Discuss: Spring 2021 is online
* No plans to reopen the lab anytime soon (paraphrased from dphan)
    * According to Eleanor, they currently don't have a set plan for the Spring, but it's likely it will follow this semester
* Anything we can do to better prepare?
