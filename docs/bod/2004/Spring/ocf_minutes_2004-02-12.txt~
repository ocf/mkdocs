Quorum Achieved
-------------

Quorum achieved, meeting starts

Eleen opens the meeting
GM Message
 - Nothing much is up, except e-mail
 - Eleen brought in new toner that she bought, it's next to the old toner
 - The building's open now
 - Staff hours are commenced.  If you write your name on the page, it's a commitment; please follow through, or if you can't, edit the staff_hours file and note your upcoming absense

SM Message
 - Yesterday jkit and jones updated quotas
 - New Quotas are twice as large as old ones:
 - Home: 200mb
- Web 120mb
 - The person who was going to donate a computer failed to do so, but said would come back next weekend.
- We should be getting two new computers.
- Devin wants to put some Linux on the new systems and give the systems to student groups who don't have resources.
- Eleen suggests a raffle of them
- Adrian: There's a nonprofit in Berkeley that is selling 10 systems via Craigslist
- Oren: there is one Dell sitting in the server room, Devin says it has a purpose.  There are four Dells in Eschleman

Old Business?
- None reported

New Business:
- Cal Retirement Center Network
 - Requests that OCF supplies accounts for their users
 - Their users are retired staff or faculty.
 - They get UCLINK, some student discounts, etc.
- They can be identified by their IDs
- Quick review of policy changes from spring general meeting.
- We don't know how many potential new users this includes.  What kinds of resources is this?
- Where do you draw the line between alumni staff/faculty, and student alumni?
- If we do it for this alumni organization, how can we say to other alumni organizations?
- Would the center create the accounts themselves?  Or would they asks us to create thousands of accounts?  Our approval system isn't automated.
- Oren: There should be at least minimal barrier to entrance; it should take at least some effort to get an account. 
- This organization is making money off their services...services that we would be contributing to for free.
- Mailing list:
- Brian Carver supports the idea because of cases like professors who have given a lot of work and years of their live to the school and just want some webspace.
- Joydip: It's difficult to try to differentiate worthy alumni from unworthy alumni; for example, we don't discriminate for/against certain categories of *current* student/faculty/staff
- Eleen: we've talked of different account types; could this make accomodating more people easier?
- Oren: Our technical support abilities are also very taxed.
- Eleen: authentication issues:  we always need to do password changes and such in person.  If they're retired and distant it is difficult.

Unknown Staff Stuff
- Does anyone not know how to do stuff?
- Not really
- Read your staff e-mail for lots of good stuff!

Projects

- WEBSITE REDESIGN
- The website design!  It needs to be redesigned and prettier.
- Devin made a new design and sent it out over break
- People were working on it
- Shiva: What needs to be on the website?
- Eleen: Everything that needs to be on a new site is already on the old site; base your new design off the old site.
- There's a webdesign user group.  It may need updating.
- If you have website ideas you can send them to jkit or eleen
- Shiva: People can submit general ideas for websites and then we can break up the project and distribute it.
- Jimmy: An important component of that is figuring out logical places tosubdivide  up the project.

- DOCUMENTATION
- the wiki!  "a customizable webspace"
- already filling in
- put your knowledge in it,
- look for knowledge there!
- send out link to wiki:
- http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/[tilde]elliot/cgi-bin/wiki.pl

- CLEAN UP THE SERVERS
- Jimmy: It'd be nice if the servers had an organized structure.  LDAP would be cool.  People should get into this stuff..and ideally do it for me.
- Patrick: The campus uses LDAP too

- Joydip: the iLamp there's no flashing question mark (the usual mark of harddrive failure).  
- Jimmy: sometimes ifyou're really lucky you'll get the flashing question mark
- Patrick: the CD-ROM drive won't open up
- Joydip: The firmware reports only one ATA device, the CD-ROM drive.  We should stick a new hard drive in there.
- Patrick: I know how to do that!  I just need screwdriver, etc.
- Oren: We're out of IPs, which is why the Macs aren't on the network.
- Eleen: So what's the plan?
- Patrick: I'll see if the harddrive is salvagable.
[Patrick becomes endowed with responsibility]

Our Mac People:
phlee, joydip
