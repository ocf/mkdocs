GM MESSAGE
- Short power outage yesterday 10:40pm
- Printer wasn't working
  - Derek was working on it, rebooted it this morning
  - Working fine now.
  - If printer stops working again, call Eleen, or Jimmy.
- If doors are locked, call building ops.
  - 
SM MESSAGE
- Someone donated an old Gateway
  - No USB, AT Keyboard (not PS/2)
  - No network card
  - Oren: Should we do anything with this computer?
    - Jimmy: I'll call Devin and see what's up.

NEW BUSINESS
- Eleen, Jimmy to have meeting with CSUA
  - Attempt to set up mutual agreement with CSUA
    - Such that, in the case of service outage
      - OCF can write about OCF downages on the CSUA webspace
      - CSUA can write about CSUA downages on the OCF webspace.
      - We could maybe also have redirects, such that in the case
        of an outage, browsers will be automatically redirected
	to alternate site (at CSUA for OCF, at OCF for CSUA).

- Classes that want usernames with numbers
  - Devin has asked if we can set up some class accounts
    - This is ordinarily fine.
    - However, these class accounts want numbers in the user name.
      - Numbers in the user name are not ordinarily allowed.
      - The account is otherwise completely normal.
      - They want mcb100 and chem130
  - Yeh: Don't the classes already get their own space from
    the official Berkeley servers?
    - Kaisen: The sites capabilities they get are really bad.
    - Jimmy: The departments have had miscommunication issues with
      the official Berkeley people who provide webspace.
  - Eleen: Why should they get this exception?  Could we just modify
    the general rule?
  - Eleen: How much harder is it to make an exception?
    - Jimmy: An extra 5 minutes.
  - Eleen: Do they know the other options?
    - Jimmy: Devin was talking with them, he most likely told them about
      the other options.
  - Jimmy: The exception is a violation of our policy.
  - VOTE FOR ALLOWING CLASSES TO HAVE NUMBERS IN NAME:
    - Fails unanimously.

- Acrobat Reader
  - User requested Acrobat Reader installed on Heller Lab

- OpenOffice
  - Discussed installing OpenOffice on Windows machines.
  - Our PowerPoint reader installations are not-full featured.
    - OpenOffice may somewhat fix this?

- Budget Request
  - Eleen has to submit a budget request to ASUC
    - OCF asks them for an amount of money that would cover everything
      we could possibly want.
    - ASUC gets back to us regarding the amount they're willing
      to give us.
  - Devin sends suggestions:
    - More RAM for Dells
    - Buying more systems
    - New printer
    - Projector
      - Devin doesn't want to give us his
    - Software
    - Webcam
      - Patrick: Why a webcam if the lab is only open 5 hours per day?
    - A BIG LIST OF STUFF, FILL THIS IN!
  - Possibility of paying CSOs
    - People who sit in the OCF during normal hours and after hours
      to monitor the lab's security.
    - Could cost up to $7000/semester?andidates' platforms
      - Contact Daily Cal to publicize our situation.
  - Heller Lab vs. The Lounge -- ultimate combat
    - we have put a lot of work into this lounge, we don't want to see
      it locked away and unusable while ASUC figures out what they want
      to do with Heller Lounge.
