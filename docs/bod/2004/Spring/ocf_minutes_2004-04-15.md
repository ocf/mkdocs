Quorum Achieved

GM MESSAGE
Money - 
We have roughly $700 left in the account that we can use. It's money that we 
can spend, and we should, because otherwise ASUC will take it away.

We have roughly $1300 in miscellaneous funds, because Fullmer bought our Dells.

Money will most likely go for printer parts.  We're hoping to use TSW for 
printer maintenance services. Although they say that they only service campus 
deparatments, we've gotten stuff from there before.

Adrian - Do we get any kind of warrantee?

nispassword changing works, but passwding doesn't -- still needs patches

Live and CSBA - It's best not to say anything, or know anything. "Trust upper 
root staff that they're doing the right thing." 

SM MESSAGE
- Jkit and Luns looked at printer. Left side of printer was jamming 
continually. Removed duplexer (thus no more double-sided printing), seem to 
make things work.
- Jkit and Luns took apart duplexer, no success fixing.
- There was a kit ordered to change rollers. Kit arrived, used kit, no change 
in printer problems.

AGENDA
- Our efforts helping w /ASUC elections are being recognized.  Good job!

- Webcam Status - Projected attempt to set up webcam next weekend. Use a Dell 
that's in the server room. Where to mount it? Same old place? Does it need an 
IP? (Use Pileup's IP, since Pileup is down)

- Eschleman computers
2 out of 4 computers are completely down, not just net.

- ASUC Wireless coverage in lab is currently semi-broken. Can only get to 
machines within our subnet. Jkit talked to Fullmer...doesn't know what's up.

Adrian motions to close
Yehfang seconds.
