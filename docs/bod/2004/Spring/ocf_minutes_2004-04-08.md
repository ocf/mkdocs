MEETING OPENS
GM Message
- The servers were down on Monday
- We were applying a kenel patch
- Derek found a security hole in passwd, needed to install patch.
- Derek installed patch on war
- Installed wrong kernel patch, war died. -> mail server died.
- Whenever you first log in, it checks your mail.  If it can't check your 
mail, the computers hang.
- Akopps and smcc backed out the patch. 
- Mail services are restored
- No mail was lost, it was just queued.
- "you got all your spam, don't worry"
- A lot of peoples' passwords got out of sync.
- Copies of peoples' NIS keys get unsynched among different servers, can't log 
in
- Have to use keylogout (but have to be root to use keylogout)
- Root people may have to individually clear NIS+ key cache
- if you can log into death but not windows, then try out logging onto 
hurricane -- it may be a unix<-->windows password sync issue.
- Derek: Famine, death and (something else) needs to get patched. 
- Derek is not going to touch death.
- Eshleman computers don't have internet, we don't know why, fairly sure it's 
not our issue but ASUC's.
- $ - 18% cut, so we have $16,000

SM Message
- Geo's Account - Somehow geo's account got sorried...we can't fix this b/c to 
unsorry you need to change password, ... we can't nispasswd for some reason.
- When people ask for virtual hosting, tell them to read the policy!  That 
webpage will tell them to e-mail sm!
They need to read the website first!
- Anybody who has virtual hosting is required by policy to put a "hosted by 
OCF" link. E-mail sm if people are in violation of this!
- Any ideas of what to do with random computers?
- What's the deal with the Mac?
- We don't know.
- Most likely out of warranty
- The dells have 3 year extended warranty we think.

MONEY
$16,000
The money that we need to run the printer, paper, toner and phone, the max is 
about $10,000 per year, including random $5,000 for emergency funds.

That leaves us with about $6000 for stuff.

Given the current budget crises, getting more money is doubtful, but we are 
going to try. We'd need a good reason.

Olivia says nothing was really cut from our budget, but everything was 
downsized.

REASONS TO GIVE US MORE MONEY?
- CSO guards, extra long hours
- RAM for Dells
- A big couch
- Disk array
- Printer maintenance?

DISK ARRAY
The only major thing that we've thought about is Devin's disk array 
suggestion, which costs about $10,000. 

Why do we need a disk array?  
War is filled to the brim.

Do we have more space?
It's better to have new hardware

RAID BATTERY
- We need to replace it. smcc says it's nontrivial.

HPUX SYSTEM
- Not likely that we'd get it
- We'd need a good reason
- It's physically huge
- No one knows the operating system.
- Power line requirements?

PRINTER
- The printer stopped working. It kept jamming.
- The printer is getting confused as to what's wrong with it
- It may be that it's time to service the printer. Rollers, fuser?
- There are two things we could do.
1) buy a kit and replace the stuff ourselves (eleen hears it's not that hard)
2) get workstation support (branch of tsw) to help us.  they say they don't 
service student groups.they're just supposed to service staff, faculty, 
students.  but we got the apple computer from them...we'd probably have to pay 
them.  they'd probably just clean, instead of replace parts.
- who's replaced parts before?
- probably luns

WE HAVE A SECOND PRINTER?
- Where is it? 2nd floor eschleman?
- Is there anything wrong with it?
- It doesn't ha

have a duplexer- no doublesided.

LOOK INTO SERVICING OLD PRINTER AND USING IT.

If people ask "when's the printer going to get fixed?" answer "it's been 
worked on."

The workstation people can come pick up printers.

DAILY CAL AD
Cal day is next saturday
Since we never do publicity, maybe this would be good.
Afraid ASUC will say "no one knows about us"
Cost: $20
What should our tagline be?
No result.

ASUC ELECTIONS
Happening next week
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday
CHECK YOUR E-MAIL
We're not getting paid, since we're doing a tech thing...instead of just 
sitting there.  The people who just sit there get money. We get nothing.
SET UP

Why are we doing this?  ...good...name...brownie points.
Where are we supposed to be? Unknown. At 6:50am.

Eleen needs phone numbers.
If the time comes, and you don't know where to be, just go and stand outside 
the OCF office, cold, shivering.

Eleen will come and open the doors.

The downtime that was supposed to happen over spring break didn't happen, 
we're rescheduling to whenever we kernel patch
