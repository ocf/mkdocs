GM Message:
- OCF (connection) down for the past 29 hours because construction cut a fiber optic cable. Replaced, but will be down again for service.
  Thanks: Fulmer, Patrick, Jones

SM Message:
- Webcam taken down for maintenance.  Going to try to restore functionality.

New Business:
- CSO program within UCPD would like a website under a group account.
Requesting that they provide a department letterhead requesting account.

- Previous email from Jeremy asked why we have separate quotas for
 mail/home/web.  Now considering merging them into one overall quota.
 Debating, clarifying the differences between different spaces, if it is
 possible to combine the quota without changing disk space partitions.
 
  Eleen brought up idea of different types of accounts.  For example,
  printing accounts, web accounts, email accounts, etc.  Many students only
  use certain services, for example, some students only print but never use
  webspace or email accounst.  

  Different Account Types
  - What happens if they want more features?
  - Can you manage the user's permissions through user groups
    (i.e. sudo style?)
  - If it's just a printing account, you don't have to sorry it because there
    aren't really security issues
  - Eleen thinks it would be a good idea to list all possible account
    feature options on the page because people don't know what actually comes
    with an OCF account
  - Matt thinks it's a bad idea to put all the possible account options
    on the account form because people will just request all the features
    even if they're not going to use them.

  - What types of account?
    - Printing
    - Shell
    - Web
    - E-Mail
    - etc.

   - Yeh thinks multiple account ideas are a bad idea because we're just
     transferring work
     - You transfer work from:
       - Dealing with peoples' sorried accounts when things go wrong
     - To:
       - Dealing with a million different types of accounts for everyone
	 who signs up, customizing each account, upgrading, etc.

PRINTING POLICY

- 250 pages per semester or 50 pages per month?
- This could ease peoples' demands--they just have to wait a short while
  until their quota is reset

Issues
- People print a lot at finals time
- 50 pages isn't too much

Other options
Make an incentive--people get more than 250 pages per semester,
it's just spread out.

Someone needs to figure out how to limit print jobs...
someone "accidentally"?!  printed 170 pages and is now
over limit.

Someone needs to make a popup message, so that every time
they print it tells them how many pages they have left.

Notification system for users?

WHO'S GOING TO WORK ON THE WEBSITE?

Yeh's thinking/working on it.

Phlee motions to close
akamike seconds.

MISC
Phlee's working on iMac

FOOD? (no conclusions)

MOVIES? (no conclusions)

Do we like idea of OCF movies after BoD? (no conclusions)
