Old Business
- Oren has spent much time fixing back room and making it look pretty and usable.

New Business
- Policy
	- User Membership
		- Policy was devised when we were using official campus networking
			- We had to comply with official campus rules
		- Policy was devised 15 years ago
		- The current policy says the following are eligible for an account:
			- Current staff, faculty, students
		- Campus has slackened up a lot
		- We're on ASUC Network
			- We don't have to follow campus rules as strictly
			- They have private agreement to allow non-campus people
				to use network
		- What has been suggested:
			- We change policy to reflect what actual user base is.
		- The Current Situation:
			- Most of our user base is alumni, because we haven't
				expired accounts since about 1997.
		- smcc has suggested changes:
			- Add eligibility to an extended group: (see )
			- Add eligibility of those people that used to be part of the
				extended group (let people keep accounts).
		- Devin adds the following suggested eligibilites:
			- People who are normally given benefits of employees
			- Such as spouses/domestic partners of student, faculty, staff
			- (The current employee would have to be currently eligible
				for the spouse to be eligible)
			- Individuals from the community who volunteer with the OCF.
		- There's been talk of expiring inactive accounts after a couple of years.
			- This may happen as well.
		- Constitution vs. Policy
			- We can give OCF resources away through policy alone.
			- Membership is decided via constitution
			- Membership only affects election to office.
		- Constitution is silent on policy changes?
		- Devin moves that we change policy in manner just discussed
			- Matt seconds.
			- Vote Done by Hands
			- Vote succeeds unanimously
		- Someone suggests a guarantee of at least 2 years for alumni accounts.
	- Quotas
		- Current Policy
			- Allows up to 5 megs of space
				- (For regular space, mail, etc.)
				- "Basically this is just retarded."
					- "There doesn't need to be a limit in policy"
			- smcc suggests policy change:
				- "A uniform limit" for all users for space, mail, etc.
				- The idea is that we don't need to change policy
					every time we change quota.
				- Ability to request a waiver from uniform limit
			- Devin adds suggestion:
				- "Or at discretion of site manager"
			- Policy change (of smcc and jones) passes
