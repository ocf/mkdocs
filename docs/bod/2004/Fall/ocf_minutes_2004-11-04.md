    - An old 300Mhz computer was donated. It will
      be scrapped for parts. Or used. Or not.
    - Jkit installed new toner
    - Akop ran fsck on ro /home, and it gave a dire
      message.

3) SM disc(retionary) fund
    - the right for SM's to spend a given amount of
      money until the next election.
    - this motion was passed

4) Simpson's Decal
    - they want a group account
    - as long as they have a sponsored faculty, this is fune
    - Yury has received complaints about people who would
      like an easier way to make web pages (like an online
      web builder)
    - Aoshi has been testing mysql 4. He has been looking
      into installing livejournal on the ocf
    - Installing such scripts may impose security threats
    - Eleen will handle this on a per-group basis

5) Eschelman Comps
    - We are going to move computers into eschelman
    - It should be done this weekend, but it probably won't
      be done until a couple weeks
    - We need to set up a couple computers.

6) Project updates
    - Ticket checking :
             This was not discussed
    - Windows imaging :
              The software has been lost, so it will most likely
              have to be done with some *other* software. Maybe do
              even do something like dd over ssh.

7) Disk array
    - Akop has lined up some disk array for comparison, but he recommends
      the intortrend disks. It will cost $8700.
    - This was mostioned, and seconded, and approved

8) BoD members
    - Mike (mbh) was voted on the bod
