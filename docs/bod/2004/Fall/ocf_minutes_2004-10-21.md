IV SM Message
	geo: not much, actually - akopps got a price quote 12 x 160 GB about 6.5K
		buying from JetScore
		if just mail -> assuming 10K users, then 176MB per user
		first need to decide how much space we want
		going to buy a new Sun, going to wait for a Sun grant
		if shut down mail accounts of inactive users, then will have a lot more space left over
		jkit: 2nd Gateway from right is broken, funny colors for some users - somebody tried to fix it - monitor is now broken.
		      bad video card? bad motherboard?
			 
V Discussion
	A. Disk Array - how much space do we need
		have 11K unique entries in the table, about 10K
		right now mail - 10MB per person
		disk on war - does more than mail
		allocated 10-11K for disk arrays
		combine mail and webspace - no: security issue, too much of a hassle
						shell and mail space are on different machines
		a 2 year warranty
		will do RAID 5 - can lose a lot
		RAID 10 is wasteful
		war is very important - causes most complains
		why not build youselves? 1) comes with a nice enclosure which cannot build yourself
					 2) make sure to run Solaris
					 3) mail is VERY important
		need to help akopps to get the specifics
		lets have a viable solution by next week
	B. Tabling
		frank: made a sign, found an old table in the server room
		jkit: has a table from Costco which could be used
		there is wireless at Sproul, so can approve people on the spot
		also want to make sure to let people know where OCF is
		people will volunteer
	C. Dell power supply
		brando: should come in by Monday
			will call them again
	D. Gaming
