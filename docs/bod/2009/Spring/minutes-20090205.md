Cardi: ASUC recall elections scheduled for Feb 23rd & 24th. OCF usually
participates in these, and get a stipend in return. Cardi will try to
negotiate a good deal for OCF. If the senator steps down, there will be
no recall election.

Jameson: IST gave a person the domain npr.berkeley.edu, but he is
migrating from Socrates to OCF.
Motion to give him vhost if IST gives permission:
In favor - 9; motion passes.

Mgasidlo: We're shutting down firestorm because we're running out of
IPv4 addresses.

Motion to adjourn
In favor - 9
