BoD starts at 7:25 PM
- We got a check for $625 from Microsoft, thanks to Elliot's donation (somehow copies of Office turned into cash), and MS matched it. The money is $100 more than all the software we bought cost. Yay.
- Downtime this weekend to upgrade user quotas to 2 GB. All severs will be down except TF2 (blight), IRC (drought), epidemic, and festival. 
- CalPerformances donated an HP color printer + toners. Pubs has their own color printer that's supposedly broken. We'll put that in the B&G room and the HP in lab. Pubs buys color toner for their Ricoh, we buy HP toners. Charge 10 pages per color page. Name of new HP printer - oilspill
- Gcwong: I have meeting with Pubs next Wednesday, will settle on Letter of Use Agreement w/ color printing
- Motion to adjourn BoD; in favor - 8
BoD ends 7:53 PM
