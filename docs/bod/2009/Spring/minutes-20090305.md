BoD starts 7:30 PM
- Gcwong: Motion to participate in CRT replacement program - allocate $500 to buy 4 replacement 19-inch LCDs through program.
	- In favor: 6, unanimous
- Jameson walks in
- Mgasidlo: Need $800 for a new power supplies for jaws
	- In favor: 7, unanimous
- Sle wrote setquota.pl, but someone needs to write another quota script, because the last 20 users jameson created have unlimited quota in certain places
- Are we going to collect user stats? We need to count how many users are overflowing the lab/computers so we can justify asking ASUC for more money. It's easier to do on the Linux machines, but harder on Windows machines. We should have this in place by the grand opening after spring break.
- Jameson is setting policy where users who do not remove compromised files or copyright violations after one week will be sorried. 
- There is a user (offer) who has used 160 gb of bandwidth in 4 days. Going to email to ask him politely to compress or move his videos somewhere else. Everyone starts watching chinesechickensalad video, has nothing to do with chicken or salad. It's spaghetti.
- Motion to adjourn; in favor - 7
BoD adjourns 8:15 PM
