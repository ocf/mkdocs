BoD starts 7:20 PM
- Motion to add kwinterl to BoD at the end of this meeting (gcwong)
	- Seconded by jameson
	- In favor: 6, abstain: 1
	- Motion passes
- Desktops & Monitors
	- We're thinking of buying 10 desktops and 13 monitors (to replace the 3 stolen Dells)
	- We have about $10,000 extra b/c of no printing from last semester
	- Maybe we should split the order up into 4 desktops + 13 monitors, then buy the 6 later
	- Will try to get the quotes this week, but last Lenovo quote was ~$680 per machine, ~$240 per 22" monitor
- IST
	- Was talking to new financial CIO of IST, they were claiming they never migrated Socrates to OCF
	- I set him straight, so now he's going to compensate OCF. 
	- Possible $1500, more server donations, and help OCF purchase educational licenses
- Windows Server
	- Right now death is a vserver on famine, and needs to be moved.
	- We also need a server to run Windows Server 2008
	- Cardi suggests we set up a test environment to run Win2008, which wouldn't require too powerful of a server
	- We could move death onto coupdetat b/c it's the only server powerful enough w/ 8gb of RAM.
	- Or we could move it onto a new desktop that we buy, but we would  want to reserve that for users.
	- So use AMD rackmount for windows server for testing, since we have a crapload of them?
	- Still don't know what to do with death. Having coupdetat as death is too risky since decal students get root (if decal ends up as a vserver on it)
- Cardi wants to comment 
	- We should be more open about what goes on in OCF, put discussions out on email thread so other staff know what's happening and can join the discussion if they want to, and learn more about the servers
- Motion to adjourn BoD; in favor - 7
BoD ends 8:18 PM
