		- Canon - will get quote
		- Campus labs seem to be moving to Xerox Phasers, so it might be better?
- Chinese chicken salad? Jameson will contact them.
- Novakyu is sharing a 1.4 GB file. He has listed his OCF webspace as an official mirror, so people have been downloading the file and h0zing bandwidth. What to do?

	- Around 10 GB / week bandwidth cap, but not official
