GM Report:
It'll be covered in the business.

SM Report:
Computers went down for a while, they're back up, we don't know why they went down...
Wayne has been working on SAMBA scripts.  We may be able to make it so windows machines require OCF membership.
Some stuff about passwords and how Windows sucks.
Some guy got sorried because he keeps locking consoles overnight.
Wayne is putting together a machine for some network stuff.  He's got $600 to do so.

Old business:

	Speaking of which, what is the logout script supposed to have in it?
		one machine recently had:		netuse /d fallingrocks

New Business:
	Proxies Policy:
	We need to make a proxy policy once we have quorum.
