	GM Report
Not much.

	SM Report
Nothing specific.

	Old Business
There wasn't any.

	New Business
Ldap	We want to get this in so the IMac and the windows machines will work better (a.k.a. be passworded for users only
 and be connected etc.)

ENS Bins	To have them get the bins you have to send a fax from the ASUC fourth floor (near Fulmer's Office).
	E and S (Excess and Salvage) is not too hard to find on the campus website.

We need to send back the keyboards we ordered because people stole the broken ones, so we have to pay for the new ones of we
keep them.

What is our policy about accounts for old accounts.
	Currently: "We only provide accounts for registered students."
	Do we need/want to change this? nope.

For future staff meetings

BoD Elections:
