LDAP:
	If we just do NISCAT or somesuch it may have enough info to start the database, and can we convince people to
	put in their passwords.  There are examples of how to use PAM (including source code) in smcc's
	/opt/source/users/smcc/ under various PAM directories.
		Over the summer we are going ot look into replacing some of the old Sun machines with newly installed
	Linux boxes (having new staff around for that install would be good and may even be fun.)
