Accounts were finally created.  The broken HDD on Blizzard has not been dealt with.  Maelstrom may also have a bad disk.

We're behind him on whatever decision he makes.

Chair
	Suzy is going to work with someone else to get this approved because she has a phobia of calling people she
		doesn't know (like Tom Baker).

Gateway Plaque
	We need to get a plaque soon! Derek will work on this. ~$500

Blinds
	We're gonna try to get these if we can.
