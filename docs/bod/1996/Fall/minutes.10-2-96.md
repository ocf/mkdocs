III. Minutes

     A Board of Directors meeting for the Open Computing Facility at the
University of California, Berkeley was called to order at 6:42, October 2,
1996 in 51 Evans Hall. The General Manager, Alan Coopersmith (alanc@ocf),
was in chair, and the Secretary was present. 
     The General Manager reported that he is continuing his research into
the replacement of the damaged drives, as well as the warranty and data
recovery options available to the Board. 
     The Site Manager reported that the last backup of the OCF's files was
made on August 13. The tapes have yet to be recovered, as the OCF is
locked out of the UCSEE library. The Site Manager stated that Kenji is
researching the possibility of replacing the circuit boards on the drives,
however, Kenji is still waiting upon a response from Quantum. The damaged
drives are covered by warranty, and the old ones will be sent out as soon
as the original packaging is recovered from the UCSEE library. The Site
Manager also reported that APS has a deal with the data recovery company
Drive Savers. Drive Savers will charge the OCF only $200 to inspect the
drives, along with a ten percent discount. Drive Savers will take the old
data and put it on the new drives. 
     The Site Manager was pleased to report that there were no equipment
failures. However, war.berkeley.edu resources are being heavily taxed
holding user's mail. Due to the unknown ratio of forwarded to actually
read mail, it is easier to have war.berkeley.edu hold the mail in que
until the home directories come back online. 
     The next Help Session is set for next Tuesday, October 8; the topic
will be an introduction to UNIX. Fliers will be drawn and posted before
the next session. 
     During Old Business, the Board discussed its options for handling the
loss of the three disk drives connected to apocalypse.berkeley.edu. The
General Manager motioned for the Board to: "pool the users on whether they
want the OCF to spend the majority of the '96-'97 budget on data recovery
or to have the money spent on upgrades to the OCF, and also, to
temporarily restore user's home directories from the tape backups onto
death.berkeley.edu." The motioned passed with nine in favor, one opposed,
and no one abstaining. 
     The Board then moved to a discussion concerning purchasing UPS for
the main servers. After an animated discussion, the Board tabled the
discussion until the next Board meeting. 
     The meeting was brought to a close by the General Manager at 7:32 pm.
The Board will hold another Board meeting at 6:30 October 9, 1996, in 51
Evans Hall.
