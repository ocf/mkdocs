     John Percival (percival@ocf) was appointed to the position of
Secretary.
     The General Manager reported that the ASUC has appropriated $11,500
for the OCF for the 1996-1997 school year. The ASUC will require a
breakdown of the budget. 
     Kenneth Nishimoto (kennish@ocf) and Elaine Chao (chaos@ocf) were appointed
as Help Session Czars. 
     The Site Manager reported that all of the Apollos, except flood and
locusts are up and running. maleficent.eecs.berkeley.edu was swapped with
the IPC in 310 Eshleman.  Michael Constant (mconst@ocf) is working on
pruning the staff mailing lists of inactive members. The Sun server
pestilence is still dead.  The user database can now approve new users. A
semi-working version of the approve test is in progress. The Site Manager
also talked with Kenji about the password synchronization process, and
reported that Kenji said "We'll get to work on it." 
     The help session czars reported that the room reserved in Soda Hall
was lost due to concerns by Soda Hall's administration. Soda Hall's
administration expressed concern about people entering the building after
the doors were locked.
     During old business, Rune Stromsness (runes@ocf) motioned to have
"quotas set at 5mb soft across users home directory, mail, and other
services." The motioned passed unanimously.
     A discussion of rereg policies followed the setting of quotas. The
Site Manager asked for a replacement for Andrew, who ran rereg last
semester. However, no board members volunteered. 
     Rune Stromsness (runes@ocf) motioned that "the general manager shall
submit to the board of directors, names of people who would be otherwise
not eligible for an account if the general manager determines that the
user will provide a significant benefit to the OCF. These people will be
eligible for an account if confirmed by the board until the next general
re-registration." The motion passed with eleven in favor, and one
abstaining.
     The board then moved to a discussion of the Disk Management Board.
After a short discussion of duties and responsibilities, Elaine Chao
(chaos@ocf), Kenneth Nishimoto (kennish@ocf), and George Gong (gong@ocf)
volunteered for the three positions on the board. The Board of Directors
approved all three unanimously.
     Following this, the General Manager presented a breakdown of the
