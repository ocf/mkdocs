III. Minutes

	A Board of Directors meeting for the Open Computing Facility at
the University of California was called to order at 6:47 p.m., October 30,
1996, in 51 Evans Hall. The General Manager was in chair, and the
Secretary was present. 
	The General Manager informed the Board that the OCF will be locked
out of it office in Eshleman Hall for one night due to buffing and waxing of
the floors in Eshleman Hall. The General Manager also informed the Board
that he forgot to order both the new drive boxes and the Uninterruptible
power supplies (UPS). The General Manager also forgot to announce the last
two Board meetings to the members of the Board, and those still on the
Board mailing list.
	The Site Manager reported that the root password has been changed.
Approximately one hundred and fifty users have had their accounts sorried
due to poor password choices. Some users have been sorried on flood to
free up disk space.  Kenneth Nishimoto found a 4500 power supply, and
swapped it with tsunami.berkeley.edu's failed power supply. Tsunami is
back online, and appears to be functioning properly. The Site Manager put
forth the idea of putting another registry on one of the OCF's other
DN5500. This was brought up due to concerns of the networks integrity when
either monsoon or typhoon crash, leading to problems retrieving user &
password information. The Site Manager has not been able to get the OCF's
Sun IPC's to connect to a terminal, and thus has been unable to get the up
and running. 
	The Help Sessions czars reported that attendance to October 29th
help session was five people. Another help session might be held next
Thursday, however, the help session czars were not certain of this date.
In the next two weeks, the General and Site Managers hope to hold a System
Administration/Solaris help session; an exact date has not been decided. 
	During the General Discussion, the Site Manager moved to
"appropriate an additional $50 for the OCF's disk boxes, as the price has
rising due to the addition of "ICE (Integrated Climate control
Electronics)" technology to the disk boxes." The motion passed with nine
in favor, zero not in favor, and none abstaining. 
	The meeting was brought to a close at 7:05 p.m. The next Board of
Directors meeting will be held on Wednesday, November 6, 1996 in 51 Evans
Hall.
