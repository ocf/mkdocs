III. Minutes

	A Board of Directors meeting for the Open Computing Facility for
the University of California at Berkeley was called to order at 6:45 p.m.
October 16,1996. The General Manager was in chair, Alan Coopersmith
(alanc@typhoon), and the Secretary was present.
	The General Manager reported that two of the damaged hard disks
have been shipped back to the vendor at a cost of $34.45. The third hard
disk will be shipped as soon as the other two are returned, as not to void
the warranty for the third disk. The OCF is no longer an official CS
group, although this does not affect the OCF very much, it will affect the
Help Sessions ability to get 306 Soda Hall. A professor with the
Geophysics department wishes to donate a Sun 4/110. Also Chuck Tomasi
wishes to donate an Apollo DN5500 with a 760mb hard disk, and 32mb of RAM.
The OCF will have to pay shipping.
	The Site Manager reported that the users home directories have
been backed up from the August 13th tapes onto death.berkeley.edu. Several
people who got accounts after the August 13th backup still do not have
home directories, however, those that did get accounts after the disk
faliure still have home directories. Some people will still have problems
with their accounts as the registry does not reflect the current status of
their home directories. The mot'd has been adjusted to reflect the current
situation, and problems with pine have been fixed. 
	The Help Sessions Czars reported that about forty people attended
the October 15 help session on HTML. The next help session will be an
introduction to both UNIX and the Internet, and will be held on October
29, 1996. Both the General and Site Managers will be holding a Help
Session on system administration, and the Solaris operating system. Staff
is HIGHLY encouraged to attend. 
	The status of the OCF's purchases was discussed during Old
Business. The OCF is still waiting on Kenji regarding the purchase of the
four tape autoloader. Kenji states to have found a cheaper vendor, and is
looking into pricing for the Board. Ken has found a vendor selling the UPS'
for about $55 cheaper than what the Board agreed upon, and will research
the matter further. 
	The meeting was brought to a close at 7:14 p.m. The next Board of
Directors meeting will be held on October 23, 1996, at 6:30 p.m. in 51
Evans Hall.
