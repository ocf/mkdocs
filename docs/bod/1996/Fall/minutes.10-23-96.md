III. Minutes

     A meeting for the Board of Directors for the Open Computing Facility
at the University of California was called to order at 6:42 p.m., on
October 23, 1996, in 51 Evans hall. The General Manager was in chair, and
the Secretary was present. 
     The General Manager reported that he has still not heard from the
campus Telecom services. The phone line in 67a Barrows Hall should be
turned on in two to three weeks, however. The General Manager also talked
to an ex-alumni now working for Veritas. The OCF might qualify for
Veritas' donation program, which would involve donating file system
software. In exchange, Veritas would like to have their name mentioned at
some point in the Mot'd or the OCF's web page. 
     The Site Manager reported that two of the replaced hard disks have
come back, however, they have not been mounted, as there is no disk box to
mount them in. The Site Manager has returned the borrowed tape drive used
for the restoration of the users' home directories. One of the IPC's
refuses to talk to a terminal, despite the purchase of a Mac serial cable.
A staff meeting was held on Monday, October 21, 1996. The installation of
the permanent network connections has not been completed. 
     The next Help Session will be an introduction to both UNIX and the
Internet. A flier will be posted Monday, October 28, 1996, if not sooner.
The General and Site Managers will be holding a System Administrator's
Help Session sometime in November. Another HTML Help Session is
tentatively planned. 
     The several purchases for the OCF are still suspended, waiting for
more information from Kenji Hubbard. A General Meeting for the OCF will be
held sometime soon during the month of November. 
     The Board of Directors Meeting was brought to a close at 7:38 p.m.
The next Board of Directors Meeting will be held on Wednesday, October 30,
1996, in 51 Evans Hall. 

John W. Percival
Secretary OCF Board of Directors
