III. Minutes

     A Board of Directors Meeting for the Open Computing Facility at the
University of California at Berkeley was called to order at 6:49 p.m., on
November 11, 1996, in 51 Evans Hall. The General Manager was in chair, and
the Secretary was present. 
     According to the new SISG handbook, giving to the General Manager,
the OCF can name up to three people who are authorized to sign for the
OCF. Only one to those three needs to sign the document however. The
General Meeting will be held on Wednesday, November 13, 1996. The location
has yet to be decided. 
     The Site Manager reported that many of the machines have been
crashing. Despite making the var/mail directory (this directory contains
users' mail) more readable for the Apollo's, there are still many
problems. The Site Manager indicated that solutions to the problems will
be difficult, but will more than likely be solved with conversion of the
Suns to the OCF's main login in machines. Concerning the OCF's purchases,
Kenji has still proving difficult to contact. The four tape autoloader the
OCF appropriated money for in September has been advertised for $995; the
Site Manager stated she will investigate further. Kenneth Nishimoto stated
that he called Inmac, concerning two UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supplies),
and two copies of the software that goes with the UPS's. Kenneth Nishimoto
also called APS concerning the prices for the disk boxes, however, APS has
yet to get back to Ken on that matter. 
     Jon Kuroda will be running the next two Help Sessions. The next Help
Session will be Thursday, October 31, 1996. The following Help Session
will be held on Thursday, November 7, 1996. The System Administrator Help
Session will be held on Thursday, November 14,1996. 
     The phone line in 67a Barrows Hall has still to be activated. Also,
there has been instances of users printing on the OCF printer from
locusts.berkeley.edu. A General Meeting for the Open Computing Facility
will be held Wednesday, November 13, 1996; the location has yet to be
decided. 
     The Board of Directors meeting was brought to a close at 7:14. The
next Board of Directors meeting has yet to be scheduled.
