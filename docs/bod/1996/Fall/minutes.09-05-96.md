The meeting was called to order at 7:20pm.

Announcements
	The next General Meeting is 8pm next Thursday, in Sibley Auditorium.

General Manager's Report
	The budget has been approved, the OCF being allotted $11,750.

	The GM said that the lockbox should be mounted soon; someone needs 
    to get bits for the drill.  However, Jennifer reminded the GM that she
    had a push drill.  The GM made arrangements to drop off the lockbox.

	Alan asked if something was being done about the Chancellor's 
    committee on WWW policies.  Elaine asked if he could elaborate a little
    more for the members who weren't there to hear it at the CSUA politburo
    meeting that Tuesday.  The Chancellor's committee on WWW policies sets
    policies on WWW for campus sites.  However, this committee does not have
    a student representative.  Alan suggested that we write a letter.
    Whether to write our own or to write a group letter was discussed; the
    GM decided to draft one for the OCF on her own, and have Alan proofread
    it.

	Help Sessions:  Ken reported that 306 Soda seemed to be the best room.
    Planning and room reservations will be done tomorrow.  Jenni heard that
    the XCF had 347 Soda.

Site Manager's Report
	Jenni and Alan reported that 67A Barrows lost power again.  A lighting
    technician was sent, but went back to get someone else when she heard
    that it was a circuit.  The Sparcs were unaffected; all of the Apollos
    except locusts went down.  As a result, Jenni and Alan brought the
    machines back up to a point where there is now balanced power outage
    across the circuits.

	Bigbang and avalanche still have active accounts.

	The plan is to keep more Apollos down in the interest of all the 
    power problems lately.

	Michael reports that the user database and approve will be working
    in a week.  The source is on apocalypse in /opt/local/source/mconst/db.
    approve.test will ask for bug reports in case of failure.

	Rereg concerns were brought up by David.  The main question was,
    "How long do we keep files?"  30, 60, 90 days after the semester?  David
    lectured on the limits of "niceness" so that people would be encouraged
    to reregister.  The point of POP-users, especially those who have never
    logged in, was brought up, and those who log in using FTP and WWW.

Sparc Manager's Report
	Elaine asked Jenni to report in the light of the SpM's absence.

	Jenni reported that while she was gone for the weekend, nfsd on
    typhoon crashed.  It ended up wedging war and apocalypse.  Mail ended
    up going to maleficent, the backup mail server.  This stopped Tuesday
    morning, when Elaine rebooted typhoon.  Unfortunately, someone hit the
    break key on maleficent, and so Jenni rebooted it.

	Jenni also reported that Kenji was not around.

	Software:  The password files are out of synch; Jenni can't seem 
    to find Kenji's source code.  The quota software is almost done, but
    Jenni doesn't like the user interface.  She also reports that it needs
    better error messages.

	Pestilence:  Nothing is being done with it at the moment; it still
    will not boot.

	POP is not working quite right.  POP processes crash every now and
    then.  War, thankfully, can keep up on backlogged mail.

Old Business
	Since Kenji is not here, no business.

New Business
	The item of the quotas was brought up, but there was no quorum.

General Discussion
	Jenni blew away mail.old from plague.  mail.old was about 510 MB.
    She has now stored all of the accounts from hailstorm onto plague's disk.

	The possibility of no SM and GM candidates for the next meeting
    prompted suggestions for bigger turnout and more publicity.

The meeting was closed at 8:30pm.
