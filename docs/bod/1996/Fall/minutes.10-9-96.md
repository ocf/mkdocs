III. Minutes

     A Board of Directors meeting for the Open Computing Facility at the
University of California at Berkeley was called to order at 6:41 pm
October 9, 1996 in 51 Evans Hall. The General Manager, Alan Coopersmith
(alanc@ocf), was in chair, and the Secretary was present. 
     The General Manager reported that DCNS has confirmed the placement of
the OCF's seven permanent network connections. Installation is to be
completed by next week. The OCF has access to the UCSEE's library, where
two Sun IPC's were recovered, while the ownership of a third IPC is still
in question. The original packaging was found for the damaged disk drives,
and they were promptly shipped off to the vendor. The General Manager also
printed many updated account forms reflecting the OCF's current situation. 
     The Site Manager reported that mail is still being delivered
manually, and will continue until the tapes containing the last backup are
restored to death.berkeley.edu. Kenneth Nishimoto (kennish@ocf) held
Monday's staff meeting, and announced that the OCF has another staff
member. Kenji contacted Keir, who promised two Sun SPARC- 2s, as well as
several Sun IPCs. Also, the KALX station director stated that she would
air the OCF's public service announcements. The script designed for the
user poll is almost finished, however, it has not been installed. Andrew
Swan suggested to the Site Manager that the user pool would not reflect
the majority of the user's wishes, but, only those users with something to
gain by having the old data restored. Considering this statement, the Site
Manager decided against installing the pool. 
     Kenneth Nishimoto, one of the Help Session Czars, reported that
attendance to Tuesday's help session was about twenty-five to thirty
people. The session ran about ninety minutes in duration. Next Tuesday's
help session will be on an introduction to HTML. The Help Session Czars
also reported that the OCF will be able to post fliers with University
approval throughout many areas of campus. 
     During Old Business, Jennifer Snider moved to: "forgo data recovery in
favor of getting disks replaced, and inform the users of the Board's
decision." The motion passed with eight in favor, zero not in favor, and
two abstaining. 
     Also during Old Business, Rune Stromsness moved to: "buy two UPS with
software necessary to run the devices effectively, up to a maximum of
$1,100 including tax, and shipping and handling." The motioned passed with
eight in favor, zero not in favor, and two abstaining. 
     After a short discussion on restoring links to the OCF web page on
the University web pages, the meeting was brought to a close at 7:30 pm.
The next Board of Director's meeting is scheduled for October 16, 1996, at
6:30 pm in 51 Evans Hall.
