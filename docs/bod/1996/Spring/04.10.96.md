1. Adjournment


Adjournment:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The meeting is called to order at 7:12pm.  Elaine <chaos> explains
that there was a FiComm meeting yesterday [Tuesday 4/9/96], but it
did not reach quorum.  Thus, all student group budgets are still
frozen, and the issue will be dealt with at the ASUC Senate meeting
today.  Unfortunately, that Senate meeting is scheduled for the same
time as this OCF General Meeting, so we must cancel this meeting so
that the OCF can make a showing at the Senate.

Elaine moves to close the meeting; the motion passes 4/0/0.  The
meeting is closed at 7:13pm.


ASUC Senate:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is not strictly part of the OCF General Meeting; but if you've
read this far, you're probably curious about what transpired at the
ASUC Senate meeting...  briefly, FiComm decided to take funds from
various executive offices to pay for the ASUC's debt to the GA.
Scott Bonds complained that it was not withn FiComm's power to do
so without the approval of those executive offices, and that FiComm
would have to present the transfer of funds as a bill next week.  A
little debate ensued, and the Judiciary Committee will rule soon on
whether it was legal or not.


Respectfully Submitted,
Michael Constant, OCF Secretary of the Week
