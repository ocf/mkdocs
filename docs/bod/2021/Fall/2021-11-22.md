  * njha: we should just have these, night uses them
  * ethanhs: prices kinda steep for 1TB
    * njha: they're datacenter drives, we wear out consumer drives quite
      fast
    * consumer drives ~1/2 the price
  * tabled
* HPC node
  * ethanhs: we don't actually have the power to run this and new k8s nodes +
    y2k
    * currently at ~1/2 of the power supply of the 3 phase supply, will be using
      most of it with the new k8s nodes
    * need to figure out power situation first
    * this node is ~2kW, currently drawing ~20.5A (7, 7, 15.5)
    * snarain: have other servers been approved and purchased?
    * ethanhs: approved, not purchased
    * snarain: finance comm can help out with
    * either need to decommission old nodes or work with building to increase
      power
    * ethanhs: we would keep old HPC node, decommission older hypervisors
  * tabled
* IFixit kit - already approved
* BT speakers
  * tabled - fydai has a speaker, use his
* WD easystore 14TB drives x12 (bestbuy deal)

    drive to get additional 10% off
  * performance limited to ~5400rpm levels
  * rjz: can do ~200writes/s, not ~250
  * it's fine, we're not buying for perf
  * plan is to shuck them and put into either new k8s or mix of existing servers
  * new drives, not replacing existing drives
  * rmxu: we need to do something about the sata ports
    * ethanhs+rjz: no we don't, tested drives before on our server chassis and
      it works without reset pin hack
  * passes (unanimous)
  * rmxu: if we don't want the 15%, then we can just go once; if we do, we need
    12 people, one dead drive per person
