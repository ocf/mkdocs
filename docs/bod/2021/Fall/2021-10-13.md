## Change BoD to Monday
*SUGGESION*: move next semester?
*kdr*: Maybe make BoD and staff meeting on separate days, there should be more time for BoD; too many time for purchase requests;
*RESOLVED*: keep BoD on Wednesday

Firedoor related stuff

## Opstaff
*rjz*: Keycard reader arriving next Monday, can produce something by next monday
*kdr*: not informed with anything happening besides being yelled at once
*kmo*: Saturday close at 1
*kdr*: purchase request took 2 weeks, would be good if possible to be shortened, opstaff meeting 1400-1430 tomorrow will discuss/conducted it; information on DD/cheque pickup
*rjz*: DD details
*rmxu*: we had one keycard reader why purchase another one
*rjz*: can’t find the original one
*ncberberi*: new one is better

## Diversity

## Finance
	
## Service
*jyxzhang*:lab printing is resuming, remote printing is “scraped”

NCBERBERI discussed mirror issues
*rjz*: IO usage dropped, mirrors fine for now but disks’ diagnostic unpromising, does not indicate immediate failure, they are new drives
*njha*: opstaff keycard reader: estimate of shipping
*rjz*: this Saturday

NCBERBERI discussed HPC issues
*anddone*: Kerberos issue, can locate issue but how to fix is unknown

NCBERBERI discussed bullseye update
*rjz*: networking service issue, can turn off duplicate record detections; UI problem: Debian 11 theme applies a while later after user login

NCBERBERI discussed RT
*jyxzhang*: new staffers doing a good job, RT good

NCBERBERI discussed staff hours
*ncberberi*: do we think there are a lot of people looking for staff hours
(omitted)
*ncberberi*: give prior notice if unable to attend scheduled staff hours
*kdr*: training people to be able to do staff hours could be the priority, a lot people may not feel comfortable doing staff hours themselves
*ncberberi*: there are documentations, don’t need much expertise
(IT IS DISCUSSED that recovering breached websites require root)	
*rmxu*: documentations are not searchable
*ronitnath*: not anymore, new.ocf.io
*ncberberi*: need to construct the new website
*ronitnath*: hopefully by the end of this semester it will be up and running

RONITNATH discussed RT resolving
*ronitnath*: bystander effect: problem is train people to resolve RT: having a small number of new staff resolve all tickets in one day with one veteran staff leading
*jyxzhang*: don’t force people to do RT because OCF staff is a volunteer-esque 
*ronitnath*: would be better involved in committee work if tell people “you are in this committee, now do relevant work”?
