Quorum for this meeting is 7

Meeting Started at 19:20

Calapalooza is this week from 5-7pm
not sure about availability for virtual tabling

First staff meeting today

Staff hours sign up through PR or ask someone for help

GYB this Saturday, did it once before
10-4pm, would be nice if people can show up

Pending tasks:
remote printing
- no updates
new toner cartridges, scheduling maintenance

kdr: printers need to be power cycled and have to manually select the trays, not an issue in the past
(~3x/hr)

ethanhs: remote printing waiting on the webcam (will pickup after meeting), will set up print stations

drafted email to printer maintenance

jobs not going through to the printer, printer at fault

broken desktops:
some nvidia driver issue
rjz got it to work by rebooting

need a count on how many not working? 4

Buy new mice, approved last week
rjz will buy them,

Keycard access
talked to Eleanor yesterday, if need keycard access or experiencing issues fill out the form

server room access furing biz hours: a few options

currently have 2 ACLs: after hours (server room) / building hours (no server room)

can add another ACL (~200$)
can add a keycard that have access to the server room to be kept in a lockbox (~$25)

seems like the SU doesn't want to give after hours access in the long term

did the issue come up before COVID?

If 200$ is one-time -> fine, if per semester problematic

Historically have after hours access, so maybe need to push the other way
will schedule meeting with Eleanor

(same form as last week's)

Ventilation
- measure CO2 levels
- contact facilities

Opstaff
kdr:
Hiring/misc.
misc first:
weekly meetings and projects will do after hiring is done, typically in the first few weeks don't have projects, but do submit suggestions

who to email about CSAs after Megan's departure? Will approach Daniel soon

PR refunds? can get information through Daniel
After hrs access: opstaff stuck outside slightly before building opens, but not so much an issue now that we open at 11

Hiring:
Application closed 9/7, we have a hiring channel on Slack, ask kdr to be added
pick up knowledge since we were remote for so long
distribution of work
asai: GMs and SMs will help out

interviews mostly done by staff with involvement by opstaff manager
timeline and jurisdiction of kdr?
typically by SM

when to finalize: ideally by Sept. 20 (application and interviews)
mostly reading applications

opstaff projects start after the 20th
will create sheets to be used

GApps situation: only kdr has functional gapps, need to gather usernames and set up accounts

Committee check-ins

Univ affairs,
gave short presentation to the ASUC senate
a few minutes to show what the OCF does
DeCal board wants assistance with their website, not official offering but someone interested can take up with possibility of getting paid

scheduling meetings: don't have one with Daniel but will set up meetings (snarain)
can kdr set up PRs?
need the CSA because that's the equivalent of receipts

Eleanor yesterday
keycard
 - will ask more about server rm access
ventilation
 - replaced old filters, need to measure CO2 level

CASSA funds
For now, opstaff will be getting paid from STF Funds
It may take some time until a replacement for EVP is found (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dDSz6TrQelcF35vamxC3MKdAn_URNpazc3C6ZmOqNXM/edit), we can either wait for a replacement or figure out someone else in the ASUC to contact for this

did funds roll over? funding for 2 semesters so will cover both semesters even if it doesn't roll over but think they should do

Is STF happening again this year? not that I know of, even if it is it may not be in the same form

Was CASSA approved by ASUC committee? It's ASUC+university administration, so need to convince both
committee part student part staff

are there people we can contact to get the funds transferred

we do have ~73k of rolllover funds from STF

Service Committee: new!
recent tickets piling up
created last semester, hope can check with them more frequently
hopefully can get more people to respond to RT tickets
ethanhs: can get more people to sign up for staff hours, come to him if you are not sure how to reply to tickets

<a lot of people here know how to respond to tickets>

Internal comm:
currently no concrete plans for socials, will have a meeting by next week
will be helpful to have a global calendar thing
presentation hack day coming soon language should be updated to social as event type still being decided

Comm comm:
a lot of people have joined the discord and introduced themselves so expecting a lot of new staff coming today, hope that they stick around
most of them will come with little experience, so need onboarding 
weekly recap emails to keep staff in the loop
any meeting plans? not currently necessary

Finance comm:
Getting financial agent role on callink
Make sure finances are in place for this semester
 - There were a few large returns in the summer
 - Make sure past funds are transferred over
Revamping buy sheet

Alum 
Cockroach Labs coming up soon, should be getting confirmation soon
Will coordinate?plan first infosession

Databricks? not sure
Alumni event - will get back with more info

Decal: 1st lab yesterday, got most stuff figured out, going pretty well

Buysheet: webcam for remote printing, need a webcam for scanning QR codes used by remote printing svcs
webcam will be used to scan QR codes and can be used as a fall back for meetings

all in favor
