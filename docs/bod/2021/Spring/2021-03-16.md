Senate presentation is tomorrow. snarain solicits people to come with him. 

Everlaw techtalk scheduled for March 31st.

No meetings over spring break.

Still looking for facilitators for the decal (as ever).

We start talking about the servers.
Njha mentions its a 4 in one system. The functions: hypervisors & ｋ　　ｕ　　ｂ　　ｅ　　ｒ　　ｎ　　ｅ　　ｔ　　ｅ　　ｓ workers, and ceph.
It would be better to have just one machine running things but alas.
No real plan for installation??? (ronitnath: talk was confusing)
Current quote: 34404 (tax inc.)
No quote for HPC - they didn't have the hardware we wanted originally.

Who's going to install? njha and fydai can't.
ronitnath, snarain, hexhu (?) could.
Need to talk to building staff.

We need to actually get it first though - min 4 weeks time to get it.
Who's card are we going to put it on? We could use ASUC card, or ask Minos.

We go to the buysheet, and discuss how long it gets.

Asai mentions it's bullshit that he's a guest.

Kmo abstains from voting.
njha, ethanhs, ncberberi, ronitnath, snarain, fydai votes yes. Measure passes.
rjz also votes yes but is guest F in the chat.

6 votes passes.
We talk about credit limits some more. Can Megan help?
Asai stalked the previous minutes; he was here on 3/2, you need to miss 2 bods to be taken off, so he's put back on.
fydai4 joins bod. 3, 2, 1 and njha: no comment.

Committee updates:

We're going to have our first Elanor in a while meeting soon.
Snarain is pretty stressed about the senate meeting.
Ronitnath mentions that sometimes they ask technical questions.
Ficomm: nothing's changed
STF: asuc is trying to confirm the STF
Fydai will come to senate.
Everlaw is 31st March. Other events are pushed back.
Alum event: Asai talks about CSGO lan. We can't do lans unfortunately.
Commcomm should do Everlaw marketing.
