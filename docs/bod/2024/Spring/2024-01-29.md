## External

* Recruitment?
  * Flyering, social media, tabling on Sproul (certain clubs still doing this, lots of crowds still there - but how effective would this be, also how to coordinate this lol), messages on Discord?
  * For new recruits, maybe have a first social soon to introduce everyone w/ a fun activity (hiking, games in lab)
* First committee meeting on Thursday 2/1, 5-6pm

## Internal

  * Have no ideas for the type of social to host this early on
  * In honor of Gryffin dropping something tomorrow
