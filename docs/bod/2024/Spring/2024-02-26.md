  * bryli: this wednesday
  * ronitnath: i will go, talk about desktop refresh again, senate chambers 5th floor esh. also talked about staff vm.
* bryli: met with Lauren two weeks ago:
  * Need ASUC Exec Board Member to submit recurring CACSSF
    * Recurring CACSSF is likely to increase with minimum wage/inflation (not guaranteed, Lauren is checking in)
      * Check back this week Thursday
      * Recurring CACSSF doesn't exist? Confirm with Lauren
    * Can switch the person in the role per month
      * jaysa: so true!
  * ABSA funding only for stipends not for hourly wages
    * So if we used ABSA to cover minimum wage/inflation we would have to the adjustment for inflation w/ an one-time stipend
    * e.g., if they work 120 hours a semester and minimum wage increased by $1/hr, we would just have them submit a one-time stipend request for $120
  * ABSA - opens on Monday, until March 6th
    * Will have OH/infosessions
    * Important for application - be able to understand how we spend ABSA funds
    * Use it or lose it - if we don't use it, will be allocated less, plan ahead
    * We use ABSA as operational funds, if we don't need as much we can apply for less
    * Last year roughly $20k
  * Kailen - ASUC Senator
    * Including chartered programs more in the ASUC
    * Can include us and invite us to the meetings
    * We're basically an auxillary of the ASUC
    * Any benefits that would be nice for chartered programs? We can give thoughts during our meetings
  * Financial audit - there were 2? Not sure if they were different
    * Both solved by @[Oliver Ni](mention://32653a5d-7680-4baf-afb1-1dfe53c15f86/user/13942bd3-07e8-483e-86ae-32ed75a53851) 
  * Can we identify graduate students? Used supernova and found LDAP roles (<https://calnet.berkeley.edu/calnet-technologists/ldap-directory-service/how-ldap-organized/people-ou/people-ou-affiliations>) but no specific assignments other than for affiliates and alumni
* Opstaff want to get OCF/MLK unlimited access, what's the plan?
* Previously we only gave OM unlimited and the rest limited due to security concerns
  * Ask about adding side door during working hours to Limited ACL
* Security is annoying us
  * Ask Lauren about this - kicked out after "OCF hours" but before building hours\n
    * Kicking out regular staff right after OCF closes before MLK closes
    * Should not need after-hours access to stay in the OCF before MLK closes
    * What do we do?
