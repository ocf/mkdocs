## Site

* Can someone rack the new server? - rjz
  * New staff VM server, already assembled, needs to be racked

## Opstaff

* Is there any way that Opstaff purchase requests can go from Stage 1 → 2 → 5 again?
  * Heavy delay when we get our paychecks
    * rjz: I think stipends have always been stage 4→5
    * just started this academic year
* Pay period 3: $2394
* Spring break: Close on 3/23?
  * SU buildings already closed on 3/30
* Job description updates (from important to less important) - feel free to suggest
  * Being present behind the desk for customer service, such as assisting users with account creation, printer maintenance, and general concerns
  * Having availability throughout the week (\~8.5hrs per week)
    * Attending job shifts and weekly team meeting
  * Communicating and collaborating with fellow Operations Assistants, Operations Manager, and/or Staff
  * Committing to personal projects for lab improvement
    * Creating OCF advertisements and documentation to spread awareness of services
    * Collecting and analyzing user feedback to give actionable advice to OCF volunteers on how to improve OCF services
* Gianna's project: burner account for when OCF is struggling/down
  * Similar to "swestudent"
  * Concern: people printing over the 20 side limit
  * idea: guest account with no password, no pages; opstaff manually add pages when someone needs to use it
    * we don't have a method for "per-seat" print accounting, only per-user
    * need to implement having a quota with 0 pages (as opposed to "not allowed to print" with group accounts)
  * Password list containing guest account password, change after days it is used
    * In the future, can disable/reenable account when necessary
* LMAO sooo we have $100+ in cash from shirts… what do we do with it?
