  ## Building Access
* Lauren meeting (@Bryan)
* Lauren's current response:
  * "I will connect with Filson and the SUFMO team to try to get a better understanding of their rules and expectations and get back to you on how we can move forward. From talking with Bryan yesterday, ya'll just want the ability to use the OCF for meeting space up until building close. 

    I'm hopeful we can come to an easy solution to allow this with some more communication."
* Our stance on Lauren's response:
  * Well, we want more than this, but we need to figure out SUFMO's bottom line before seeing what's possible. We don't have good informational access 
* MLK closure at 5pm Monday and Friday
  * Serious problem, plus building security being more active with enforcement lately
  * Only way to apply pressure is to send more emails, still working on figuring out if the ASUC can be helpful here
    * Currently using this method
* njha: Who is telling the building that the reason we want to have after hours access is to hang out? Like yes, that would be nice, but the *primary* thing that we need is after hours access in case something breaks. Apparently this semester they don't respect the AH access we do have (someone came by and said that *nobody* is on the list for AH access). In terms of priority we need…
  * Access during regular hours (not at risk)
  * **Access 24/7 for maintenance (at risk, critical!!)**
    * ^^ This should be our priority right now!!! We cannot have servers in MLK if we cannot access them during building close!!!
  * Access 24/7 to hang out (completely gone, very annoying that this changed and it doesn't really make sense bc why kick out people who are definitely students and are already inside, but also less important to us)
  * They said that "the OCF does not have after hours access, it was only when there was a state of emergency, due to COVID"
    * Currently there is no "state of emergency", and there are no OCF members who have ever had after hours permissions after COVID lockdown was removed
      * Do we not have after-hours? Can we get it?
    * Sometimes we get kicked out by SUFMO staff, sometimes we get kicked out by security staff
      * Communicate to Lauren that we need to figure out whether security is also part of SUFMO and how to communicate with them

  ## Opstaff

* NixOS desktops are basically completely working now
  * Printing, Audio, Login, etc.

  * It has backups now! Once a day at 4 AM (UTC lol)
  * We can migrate more things to it now :)
* Buying higher-spec machines with GPUs? Probably 4060.
  * Probably upgrade CPU to a 7700x? 8600G = 7500f, not very powerful as a CPU


## External

* tech talks:
  * People who have reached out: bencuan, mdcha, andylo, ethanhs
  * mdcha - 4/3 at 8pm

## Internal

* Social was last Saturday
* Hope that went well
* Thoughts on moving GM to right after BoD due to super low turnout
* Getting frustrating preparing presentations to present to like 2 people (the 2-3 meetings with more than 2 people aren't indicative of turnout for all GMs this semester)
* Will plan for social mid April sometime (maybe, depending on interest)
  * 29th is the first day of RRR

## Finance

* jaysa: next semester, ficomm handle smaller purchases like tissues, paper, staples, etc.
  * Make an allocation, report to BoD for what is purchased without vote (but buysheet isnt transparent)
