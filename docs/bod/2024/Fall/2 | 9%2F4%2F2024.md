## Administrivia

* rjz was charged for the broken fuser that was to be returned but was disposed of \~$484, see buysheet
  * ordered 2 fusers in feb, 1 was broken and supposed to be return, jaysa prob threw away on accident


* OCF color printing???
  * 20 sides per account per semester
  * How much pages did we print last semester?
    * 234439
    * 10% so 24000
      * color printing may or may not require slightly better paper (24lb)
  * a recommended printer on rtings (MFC-L8905CDW, also rec'd on reddit):
    *  0.151 US$/print,  0.401 US$/print (photo)
  * people most likely want to print posters so lets assume 70% photo 30% docs → 0.326$/pp
  * 0.326$ \* 24000 = $7824
  * Printer $770, Maint $1000 (assuming)
  * total cost 1st semester $9600
  * quite steep!
    * based on standard toner yield ($350)
  * inkjet would be cheaper
    * inkjet option epson 5850
    * costs $4300 or less first semester
      * or as low as $1000 for the first 2 years??????????

    * in the long run reliability is worse
    * we need 5880 for PostScript support lol
    * need to implement accounting
  * jaysa: will look into moffitt copy center for toner

## Site

## Internal

* Interest form: <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeVW59tTRlt1cGE1Y_CKEcOYdIT23YBo8QJggGXxvsGbfIjOA/viewform>
  * 77 responses!! Huge thanks to everyone who participated in recruitment!!
    * majority freshmen
    * mostly CS/EECS/DS/Applied Math
  * Ed posts, tabling, fairly successful
* Next GM: notified all interested members, intro to OCF history structure and operations
  * oliverni: not sure if talking about history and structure is best
    * worried that it might come up as too impersonal
  * meet the staff?
    * oliverni: good but… I wonder if there's a more structured way
    * people just leave
  * storce: Feel like GM is more like introduction where people come and the follow up part is more personal
* attendance: two unexcused absences = kicked from board :bangbang:
  * when we used to use the minutes utility that was handled automatically
  * should be easy to resume that as a quick fix, just import Fa24 minutes
* todays slides: <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BSgF9YW_ElrNOmS-32BaEOqstfWpKXDqcilidfAyh2A/edit?usp=sharing>
* Ideas for onboarding:
  * storce, lukep: assign projects to new staff (small groups, 4-5)
    * need ideas for projects (need to be simple enough but not extremely simple)
    * graphics design
    * technical ones are going to be too involved, intimidates people
    * adopting new staff??
      * give tasks to small groups of people
    * oliverni: improving things that people feel they have a stake in
  * jaysa: how about we make groups for projects via board games
  * RECOMMEND TO TAKE DECAL!
    * bencuan made staff onboarding sections
  * Project ideas?
  * oliverni: need to get people to take interest in the lab before they will have interest to take on tasks
  * ultimately the reason that I'm here was that I could talk about things w/ people who care about the same issues
* PC building scheduling?
  * wont happen at today's GM, will handle later


## External
