The meeting was called to order at 7:46pm.  The General Manager was in the
chair and the secretary was present.  The General Manager reported that they
lost the original order for the tapes, so he reordered them (25 total as they
had gone down in price).  He also said that we should have the 3 disk boxes
by next week or in two weeks.  The Site Manager finished removing the
un-rereged accounts from last year (about 9500 were removed).  We have about
4500 users now.  The new version of PINE was installed on the Apollos.  The
Help Session Representative reported two new Help Sessions: "Security and
Security Systems" and "Intro to HTML" scheduled for this Wednesday and next
Monday respectively.  People are invited to mail helper@csua if they have
topics.  The EJC Representative reported that the EJC is still preparing for
E-Week.

The Rereg schedule might be changed so that there willbe more time for people
to reactivate their accounts.

The budget proposed this year is similar to last year except $500 was taken off
of programs.

The meeting was closed at 8:29pm.
