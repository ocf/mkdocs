Snider (jenni), Alan Coopersmith (alanc), Rune Stromsness (runes), Elaine
Chao (chaos), John Percival (percival) and Richard Dunn (dunnthat).

All were members of the Board.

The meeting was called to order at 7:49pm.  The General Manager was in the
chair and the secretary was present.  The General Manager reported that he
picked up the tapes, ordered the drive boxes, and searched in vain for OCF
Letterhead.  The Help Session Representative reported that she slept through
the scheduled Help Session today.  The EJC Representative reported that the
EJC is still preparing for E-Week.  They are advertising and hope to make it
as big a possible.

The budget form this year is a lot more itemized than previous years and
requires a program list be included.

The Letter to Tien dealing with the possible use of $720,000 to provide web
pages is still underway.  No new progress was made.  The subject of the
letter is that we support money for instructional technology, but feel it
could be better spent on other uses.

The General Meeting was proposed to be Wednesday, April 2 at 7:30pm.  It
passed unanimously.

The meeting was closed at 8:47pm.
