-Semesterly recap
--cooperc brings up an RT about changing committee structure
--Have had success in various things such as maintaining conectings, STF renewal, new staffers
--Failed to retain staff members who came to original meetings
----Maybe because we haven't reminded staff of events
--committee system has done well in general, but shortcomings mentioned in RT ticket
--Noticing people from previous years are gone, hard to retain people in OCF
----Should be conscious of current staffers, not just always focusing on new staffers
--Switched from family system to breakout sessions during staff meetings
----Breakouts are going fine, but hard to balance interest (one usually more popular than others)
--Where are we trying to draw people from?
----Maybe want to advertise our more technical projects to attract EECS/CS students
--Things in OCF that are vestiges from previous years
----Current system is constantly being changed
----Staff meetings should be more focused on certain tasks/events
----Way things were: come to staff meeting, hearing someone talk about something
------Cool, but how does that encourage new staffers to join?
------Not inherently bad though
------Administrative aspects of OCF should be exposed to new staffers
------Two ways staffers get involved: socially integrated or technically integrated
------bernardzhao would like to see new staffers directly connected to these methods of getting involved
--andylo points out low social retainment, new staffers don't stick around to be social/hang out
--vio points out that very few people come to staff hours
--php notes that there seems to be a barrier to entry, hard to understand what's going on
----hard to know how to get integrated from the perspective of a new staffer
--cooperc notes that there are a lot of things that differentiate the OCF from a typical CS club
----Should advertise this culture
----So much to offer, don't bring up the best things about the OCF
--Need elevator pitch for OCF, we struggle to pinpoint important things to talk about
----Current pitch is to appeal to people's technical interest
--Suggestion to make bod 1.5 hours instead of 1
--skuklinsky suggests group projects
----If a group of people share an interest for working on a project, group them into a team and make it a bit more formal

Committee Updates
--University affairs
----Need more people to come to meetings because when GMs switch out, the people filling their place will not have the information that current GMs have
--Staff affairs
----On the right path to achieving vision of having these social events, still trying to increase attendance
--Outreach
----No updates
--Interior
----Finally did storage and server room cleaning
----Goals: reimagining OCF space
------People were receptive to having larger table, more parallel to window, removing some couches
----Lighting: still have time, looking into LED sign
----Need help from bod
------After last week, cleaned a lot, but still many loose items on shelves (books, lids, misc)
------Would like to authorize >$500 to get organizational units for storage and server room
--------Moving/adding shelving, and reorganizing would give us more space to do things

--cooperc wants to highlight RT 8594 and RT 8597, but out of time to review now

--Next week bod is happening at 8pm because of a tech talk happening in the lab
