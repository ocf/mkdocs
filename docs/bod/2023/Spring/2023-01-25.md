### Opstaff Updates
- (moved to top of the agenda per request last week) jk lol can we move back towards the end
- in contact with Mickael abt paperwork for opstaff - there is none
- still finalizing work schedule (things not as flexible as last sem)
    - some times (3-6 TuTh) where nobody is available to cover
    - may need volunteer staff, figure something else out for large blocks
    - consider schedules when hiring next semester?
    - when conflict, ask if volunteer staff are available, close the lab if not -njha
- hiring for this sem (1 OM, 3 Opstaff)
    - ideal timeline for this; get started on sending app asap so apps get submitted before spring break and we can look them over during the semester
    - post spring break --> interviews
    - for OM Isabelle and Jeda are both interested (both second years) --> if either are selected; limit term to one ~~sem~~ year and have them return to opstaff?
        - prefer to have one person? -njha
        - might be beneficial to have different people rotate -rameesha
- ceiling leak update in #opstaff (academic buildings being prioritized)
    - problems with SWE?
    - maybe we should just cover it and reopen the area since it's not leaking right now
