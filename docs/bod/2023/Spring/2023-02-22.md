      * +25 hours per opstaff to account for “potential saturday shifts” (Rameesha)

  * Had a meeting with Lauren 2/21:
    * Looked over application, left some comments (to be resolved)
    * Will ask Mickael about “consultation” question (people who we are supposed to be consulting - James, Chaka, Sutton - don’t want to be consulted about it)
    * Lauren will also send a follow-up to Chaka: approach to this is to ask for what he can recommend us to - not necessarily CACSSF
