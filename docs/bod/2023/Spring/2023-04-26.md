        - we haven't been following the voting system sooo
        - 2016 voting system: >50% majority


ethanhu: I propose an amendment to section 5.3.1 of the OCF Constitution to read:

> The election of officers shall be by secret ballot. Each ballot shall be a single candidate preference. A simple majority of those casting votes (including abstaining votes) is required to win the first round. Write-in votes shall be counted during this round. If on the first ballot no candidate receives a simple majority, then there will be a runoff between the top two tickets. Alternatively, another voting method may be chosen with the approval of at least two-thirds of the members of the board.
