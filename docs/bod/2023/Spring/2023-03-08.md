- SWE updates: most issues now relate to HDMI, at least one staff volunteer to be present if possible
    - oliverni/kian volunteer
- Projects:
    - Subdomain moratorium graphic for ig --> any specifications?
        - try minimize messaging, direct to website
        - should be informational (not sure if accepting more signatures to senate resolution now)
    - General socials --> Meet the staff soon & did you know series
    - Opstaff updated guide --> more streamlined way to communicate computer issues to staff?
        - can use RT tickets, but that's probably worse than slack
        - volunteer staff should check regularly
