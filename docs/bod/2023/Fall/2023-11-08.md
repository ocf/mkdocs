## Finance Committee

* **A more finalized retreat budget made:**

  ![](attachments/edd48781-173b-41f5-9c18-72fd7557e025.png)
  * AirBnB spending already approved on buysheet
  * Gas, food, rental car compensation to be done with retreat fee money (retreat fee money should be more than good enough to cover non-Airbnb costs)
  * Remaining retreat fee money to be given back
  * See (<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l8IaMO4DlSNTtJzMRV8B3mGblcmZhlVfUXgoR2pqkFc/edit#gid=729962859>) for approximate food breakdown by meal. 
  * Any additional spending beyond AirBnB money and retreat fee money must be put in buysheet and be approved in BoD
  * No OpStaff stipend required during the retreat, as MLK is closed this Friday and Saturday
  * Spending less misc fund than expected, especially thanks to surprisingly few rental cars
  * Note that cost may still change a bit, but these should be pretty good estimates
  * *Thoughts?*
* **Resuming work on the dashboard**
  * Cannot use API
  * Can attempt to crawl or scrape for more autonomous or complex interactions with CalLink
  * Will use Beancount/Fava for now, but will try to add manual graphs (e.g. line graph to show if we are overspending or understanding funds with expiration funds)
  * Will work with others to have password protection and to have the graphs stored in OCF server
  * *Internal deadline of completion: End of November* 
* **Bake sale (preliminary round)**
  * Want to thank Eleanore for hosting and marketing the sale! :drooling_face:
  * Sold 10 cookies for $1 each; cookies cost $4.99 overall, leaving us with a $5 net gain
  * Hard to scale for now, though -- demand was not very high
    * Hard to scale during career fairs as well, since companies give out free snacks during career fairs
  * njha: the ocf should probably not spend too much time on trying to make money by selling cookies. if opstaff want to have fun making cookies that is very cool though
    * yehchanyoo: We will keep sales a strictly OpStaff-driven event -- FiComm will only work to handle the finance-related aspects of the event, but will not run the events independently and will not manage the marketing aspect of it

## Decal Committee

* **ðŸ—¿ðŸ—¿ðŸ—¿ðŸ—¿ðŸ—¿**
* njha: nobody showed up to my decal lecture :( and i was very sad. i don't like decal anymore.
  * ![](attachments/1f6aa2e0-0ec2-4190-83d0-66e488349ac1.png)njha be like:
