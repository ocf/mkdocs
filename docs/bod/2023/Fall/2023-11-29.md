## Finance Committee

* Checking on retreat payment
  * Bryan: PR?
    * $1365.85 -- $270 lower than calculated
    * Airbnb cost in the spreadsheet included parking costs (as the Airbnb rent owner charged OCF the parking costs), which ended up being paid by Trinity instead of Bryan
  * Trinity: Donation of remaining money to misc fund?
    * trinityc: All outstanding items have been paid, I used the venmo retreat money + my own, so I am at -$186 ; will be requesting PR from misc -- is this acceptable?
      * This would be putting us at $1365.85 (airbnb) + $186 from misc funds instead of the projected $1390
      * Went a bit above, don't know where the number went
      * yehchanyoo: **Overall amount of money spent was fairly accurate -- it's more that Trinity ended up bearing more of a burden than we expected**
    * yehchanyoo: This is surprisingly high -- maybe we could discuss this during the FiComm meeting, as I feel that this might be a bit of a complex discussion
    * trinityc: Can I go ahead and put the PR? we can't really undo the costs at this point
    * yehchanyoo: The PR must have a clear purpose with valid documentation -- otherwise, ASUC will drag its feet on the transaction.
    * trinityc: I can put in gas receipts
    * trinityc: or I suppose I can just donate $186 to the OCF :p 
    * yehchanyoo: No need to do that, butâ€¦may need to discuss this during the GM/FiComm meeting
* Will discuss OpStaff payment for extra hours this Saturday
* Will try to work on dashboard and handbook throughout this week
* Complaints about some transactions that are moved to Stage 2 without BoD approval -- still preserve special privileges for spending among the leadership?
  * Should try to have the transactions be approved by BoD before moving transaction to Stage 2
* Will be discussing the Misc Fund spending on the banquet

## Decal Committee

* trinityc: CUDA lecture (by lemurseven) will be next week
  * TUESDAY 7 PM
* trinityc: we need people to help with grading/grades!!
