 - Licensing non-code
    - No one has a good reason for CC-BY-SA or CC-BY-ND
    - Unanimously in favor of CC-BY 4.0
 - Almost all in favor of joining the EFF's Electronic Frontier Alliance
    - We think this fits well with our principles
    - No obligations, at least at this time
 - Meeting with Becca today
    - Pubstaff getting budget cuts, may not be staffing our front desk
      next next year
       - If we hire our own front desk staffers, would need about ~$30000 in
         extra funding
          - Would like to have paid persons run the front desk for
            accountability incentive etc.
          - Front desk staffers
             - Can also be OCF staff, but would have a separate paid position
             - Would also be responsible for creating group accounts, changing
               toner as well as paper, and other routine tasks
          - Must decide if we are willing to take on this commitment
          - Must work through red tape
          - Possible sources of said funding
             - Increased ASUC funding through the normal process
             - ASUC funding through a separate channel
             - Direct student fees Ã  la Daily Cal???
    - The Amazon Student Lounge (?) would like to partner with us
       - Would like us to do at least one of the following:
          - Putting signs around our space teaching people how to use the
            Amazon Lockers upstairs
          - Putting a link on our homepage to asucstudentunion.amazon.com
            (uh...)
          - Making our start page asucstudentunion.amazon.com (ew)
          - Making a browser window with asucstudentunion.amazon.com pop up
            upon login (eww did they really think we'd run adware)
       - Revenue generated will go to the MLK/Eshleman space fund
          - And not us?
          - __Maybe__ they can get it to go to us.....
          - Oh wait, then other places will have an excuse to cut our budget...
 - New ASUC charter
    - Current draft:
          1.1    ASUC Open Computing Facility (ASUC OCF) is organized as an
                 ASUC Program pursuant to ASUCBL 3201
          1.2    The ASUC OCF shall provide an environment where no member of
                 Berkeley's campus community is denied the computer resources
                 he or she seeks, appeal to all members of the Berkeley campus
                 community with unsatisfied computing needs, and to provide a
                 place for those interested in computing to fully explore that
                 interest.
          1.3    The ASUC OCF shall provide computing services to the ASUC,
                 including hosting the ASUC website, in coordination with the
                 ASUC Administrative Office and Chief Technology Officer.
    - Commentary:
       - Chris's previous commentary: "The charter is missing a few things that
         were very important to us when we became a program:"
          - It currently lacks the ASUC's responsibilities (providing us
            adequate funding and space for a computer lab and server room).
          - It should state clearly that OCF is eligible for roll-over funding.
          - It should be clear about the OCF's independence (decision
            making/governance, ability to choose projects and write our own
            policies, etc.).
          - Our name is OCF, not ASUC OCF.
          - It should be more specific about the "computing services" we provide
            (we've agreed to host the website, but otherwise we can "consult"
            or "offer assistance" rather than what it currently says ("shall
            provide computing services to the ASUC")). This statement is too
            blanket for our comfort.
          - Overall we're pretty much fine with moving the charter in a
            direction like this, just need to work out the details.
       - "The ASUC OCF shall provide an environment where no member of
         Berkeley's campus community is denied the computer resources he or she
         seeks"
          - Uh, no, we can't provide everything that every member of Berkeley's
            campus community would like us to provide
          - Better statements: "OCF shall seek to provide", "It is the intent
            of the OCF to provide" (the latter is from our constitution
            preamble)
 - Deforestation is rapidly dying
    - ldw has suggested HP M806dn, on account of its largest recommended page
      per month capacity (28k)
    - There aren't any other serious contenders (do we trust Lexmark printers
      to work with GNU/Linux?)
    - Consensus to buy one immediately

Meeting adjourned at 8:17pm due to yet another fire alarm.
