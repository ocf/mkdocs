     Open Computing Facility Board of Directors Meeting of Feb. 18, 1993

Present at this meeting (BoD Members denoted by a *) :

	*Rune Stromsness (runes@ocf)	*Chris Williams (clw@ocf)
	*Mike Lee (mlee@ocf)		*Kinshuk Govil (kinshuk@ocf)
	*Peter Norby (norby@ocf)	 Jean Yim (jyim@ocf)
	 Marco Nicosia (marco@ocf)	*Keir Morgan (kmorgan@ocf)
	 Andrei Cogan (coganman@ocf)	 Peter Mardahl (peterm@ocf)

	Sadly, at this time, we thought that there were not enough BoD
members to make quorum. It's since been discovered that last semester, the
BoD set a minimum of 5 members to make quorum. However, since we didn't
know this at the time, we decided that this was a ``null'' meeting where
we couldn't do anymore more than discuss the issues (basically, we
couldn't take any votes.)

	Keir and Partha discussed when BoD members are dropped from the
BoD. The current policy stands as: If a BoD member misses two meetings in
a row, he or she is dropped from the BoD at the BEGINNING of the second
meeting that the BoD member is absent. This is done in the interests of
lowering quorum as quickly as possible so that the BoD wastes as little
time as possible. Since all BoD members were present at the last meeting,
nobody was dropped from the BoD this week.

	As there was little else to discuss, we adjourned our 
unofficial meeting.
