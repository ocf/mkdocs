Quorum for this meeting is 8

Meeting Started at 19:11

* <6159>: <Raising Printing Quota for dead/finals week>
    We did this last year, it will be 20 per day.
    Nick: We should change the technicality that only BOD can change the quota once it has been established
	This power should go to the GM, for speed
	BOD can be override the GM proposed change
	Patrick: Why can't we propose the quota in the BOD before the semester ends?
	    Sahil: It's neither feasible nor does it cover all the cases that could occur
	Jason: I'm not that open to a GM unilateral decision over this
	Brian: We should avoid changing quota during a break
	    Nick: When else are we going to do it? We can't change it in the middle of the semester due to confusion
	Kevin: I'm afraid that the cabinet will sweep the changes over staff
	    Nick: This discussion will be public on email anyway, and tbh staff follow what cabinet says anyway
	    Sahil: BOD can always overrule it anyway
	Kevin: So the amendment is---if OCF is not in session, the cabinet has control over quota until first meeting of next semester
    Vote: Printing quota upped to 20/20 for dead/finals week
    Vote: Cabinet has power to change quota if OCF is not in session
    Both votes passed.

* <6203>: <Tshirts>
    Insta-shirt has printed a few proofs in econ-mode (no white ink), which they suggest due to our light background
    The vote sent out over the weekend shows that we are getting American Apparel, with Gray leading the vote
    Full-color, regular printing: 23.50
    Econ-printing: 16.50
    Sahil: Full-color will look brand-new for longer, but get cracks in the white paint
	   Econ will simply fade, getting lighter and lighter
    Screenprinting on the text in the back
    Vote: Econ vs Full-color
    Winner: Econ
    Vote: Gray vs. Blue shirt
    Winner: Gray shirt
    Matt: If any orders need to be changed, talk with me immediately
    Subsidizing: Given our current financial situation, we will not be subsidizing
	If someone is genuinely in financial hardship, talk after meeting.

* <6189>: <4/20 Post-mortem>
    About 5:50-6:00am, DNS failed, so basically everything failed
	Website, emails, etc.
	We only have 1 DNS server, the university used to also host us
	    University did a recent migration to InfoBlocks, delegating DNS to us
		This means all traffic goes to our nameserver (single point of failure)
    Firewall starts blocking things due to the DNS outage
    jaws and hal were restarted, no faults found
    Theres a big post-mortem document
    Lessons:
	Redundant DNS
	Resolve firewall dependency on DNS
	IRC/email dependency on outages (Slack, etc)
    We're still not really sure on what the actual root cause is
	We should investigate---before the logs go away
    Brian: How did this affect our 9's
        Jason: We're still at 5 -- 9.9999% availability!
    mcint: Looks like there were failures to resolve that happened before and all the way until 4/20
	Jason: That probably happens because random people are using recursive DNS queries, which we don't allow unless its a lab computer

* <6138>: <End of semester of LAN>
    Current schedule: Hacking session at 1pm, LAN at 7pm Sunday, Kickback at Andrew's House on Monday
    We'll order food, Brian will bring board games
    Sahil: Last time to see nickimp truly tilt into an orthogonal dimension

Milestone: WE HAVE RESOLVED THE ENTIRE BOD QUEUE YAY
ldw bet nickimp $50 that it would never be fully resolved (this is now in minutes)

Since we have no more tickets,

RIT: Intern positions available at RIT, will be paid, this summer
Sahil: Their equipment is dope.

2003 Alumni approval:
    Jason: I wanted to create a few accounts
    Vote: Approval for Jason to make these accounts
    Vote passed

Meeting Adjourned at 19:51
