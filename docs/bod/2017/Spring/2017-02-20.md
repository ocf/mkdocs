* 5942: OCF HPC Interest survey
   - mattmcal made a survey for what requirements users might want on our HPC
     server
   - Send it out to as many student groups/research groups/etc. you can find
* 5944: GPU server update
   - nickimp made a draft build for the GPU server
   - We'll have to make some compromises to be within budget
      - nickimp proposes to compromise on storage now, because it's easiest to
        add later
   - We'll have to wait for 1080Tis unless we want to get Titan X now
      - Can we get student discount
      - tmochida: will Silicon Mechanics offer it immediately
         - Can always buy separately

      - Someone help Nick with planning this out
