Meeting Started at 19:12

* rt#5952 : Sub to youtube! 

* rt#5167 : VHost policy
  - case study: Berkeley consulting groups
  - relinquishing domains (inactive/disabled)
    - Must be a valid student org (Reg w/ Lead Center)
    - Actively reclaiming or only when needed to?
      - Probably the latter due to effort reasons, student orgs disappearing/reappearing
    - Contact prev owners before changing ownership (2 week grace period)
    - Following ^ we disable the site, and after another period, we give the domain away
  - multiple domains
    - Typically one, but sometimes groups have multiple
    - When can this occur?
      - Proposal (re *.berkeley.edu): 
        - Give new one
        - Have a small period of time where they have both
        - Disable old domain 
        - Reasoning: Prevents cases where a group can have many domains
          - Counterpoint: Secondary domains are rarely given, so the above case should not be worried about.
      - Maybe a hard limit of 2?
  - Individual domains
    - Currently policy does not allow usually (defacto faculty exceptions)
    - Due to ease of being a student group, getting vhosting is pretty easy.
      Furthermore the student will probably leave in a few years
    - The above situation doesn't really apply to faculty
    - Certain work scales w/ no. of vhosts (try to avoid)
    - Proposal:
      - Indiv accounts limited to faculty/staff
      - Will not give out emails regardless
      - Request that they ask their dept first

* rt#5942 : OCF HPC interest survey

* rt#5860 : New standing desk setup
  - Subtotal: $2238/$2283 for 48x30/60x30 (Total cost est. ~$2450)
  - 60" would go past the pillar.
  - Counterpoint: Why not allocate this money towards a more powerful server
    - Is it strong enough?
    - CCP: We should be serving the entire school pop. not just a few research group
           A bit late to bring this up, esp after several weeks of planning
  - Counterpoint: Is it too soon to buy it?
    - Didn't realize we were buying this meeting.
  - Result: Vote for $2500 allocation: Postponed 'til next week.

* rt#5268 : T-shirts for new staff
  - Looks great!
