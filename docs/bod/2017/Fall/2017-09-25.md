Meeting Started at 19:12

* 6621: updates from ASUC meeting
   * We have no idea when tech fund is submitting their referendum for extension
   * Their funding sunsets in 2021, our funding runs out in 2019
   * If they're planning to submit a renewal before our funding runs out, we ought to pair up
      * We'd like a fixed amount of their funding to go to us, ideally
      * At least we should help them, if only to help our own funding
   * Jenica brought up several points of contact
      * Larry Conrad
      * Ian Bullit
      * Vaibhav Srikaran
      * The STC (not to be confused with the STF or STFC)
   * Big Give?
      * Get alums to donate - but for that matter we'd be better off having them donate to us
      * If pay with Stripe, Stripe takes a cut
* 6620: New logo designs from ASUC
   * The ASUC Branding Office made some new logo designs for us (thanks!)
      * abizer: in some logos, the scarf overlaps over the O
      * abizer: why rounded
         * baisang: I like rounded better because the O is round
      * abizer also likes the straight black and blue one
      * dkessler likes the pattern on the scarf
      * We decided to ask for a patterned scarf that goes around the O
      * minos: Would people know that the penguin in the middle is a "C"?
      * kuoh: moving penguin to O considered harmful because it's not symmetric
      * dkessler likes yellow squares on a background of blue on the scarf
         * baisang thinks that looks old
* 6568: Economode printing
   * daradib suggests removing the economode setting from the PPD so Image Quality doesn't
     show up on the printer settings dialog
   * dkessler will handle this
* 6590: Lecida tech talk
   * Probably 10/9
   * Someone make a bitly (or an ocf.io...) to the signup form
* 6514: Plan Yelp tech talk
   * Same
* 6619: Committee on Student Fees Web Design Opportunity
   * Join if you're interested
   * baisang will announce at staff meeting
* 6595: Figure out where/how to dispose empty toner
   * Let's plan a day for people to pack toners into boxes and cart them off to Staples.
   * Then we can get rewards ($2 per empty toner)
* 6594: Find cheap snacks
   * No snacks yet
   * baisang is not looking for any
   * kpengboy suggests mangoes
   * mcint suggests nutella
