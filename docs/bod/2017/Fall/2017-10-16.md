Jenica's office has designed new logos for us and submitted them for our consideration.

 - ocf-inline-logo.png: top logo or bottom logo?
   - A majority of directors present voted in favor of the top logo.
 - ocf-noborder.png vs ocf-withborder.png
   - A majority of directors present voted in favor of having the border.
 - ocf-withborder.png: top logo or bottom logo?
   - A majority of directors present voted in favor of the bottom logo.

Thus, it stands that our two new official logos, which shall be used alongside our
current logo, are the top logo of ocf-inline-logo.png and the bottom logo of
ocf-withborder.png.
