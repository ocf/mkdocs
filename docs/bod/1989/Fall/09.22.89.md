        Quorum was not achieved, so this meeting didn't count for
strikes on the attendance rule.  Nevertheless, we did discuss a number
of things, and the general manager decided the following:

                1. BoD meetings scheduled for 7:00pm, every monday
                   including tomorrow.

                2. We will have a general meeting, Thursday, 10/5/89.
                   No particular time was specified.
