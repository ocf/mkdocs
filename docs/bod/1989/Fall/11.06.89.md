	Meeting opened with discussion about printer support.  As we are
out of toner, the printers have been shut down.  Partha was urged to 
quickly attempt to resolve getting us support.

	Bug of the Week: Case's reinstallation of GWM had caused several problems.  
Most were reportedly fixed by meeting time.

	Long discussion on the General Meeting next week.  Main disagreement was
over whether to have our Tutorial session before or after elections.  Drifted into
long arguement about the decision making process, decided to continue the 
consensus method.  Eventually agreed to run the following schedule:
	General Meeting
	7:00 General OCF Spiel
	~7:15 Tutorial 
	8:15 Begin Break
	8:45 Begin Elections Meeting

During above debate Boyd was elected to the OCF board.

Meeting ajourned about 9:20
