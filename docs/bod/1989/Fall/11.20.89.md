	Unless anyone who missed the board meeting raises an objection,
BoD meetings will continue to be scheduled for 7pm every Monday.

	Case Larsen will call Mike Wyler about shipping the dead
workstations back to Apollo.  [At this moment, Saturday night, I see
that Apollos have indeed disappeared. --AJR]

	Partha Banerjee will make a more vigorous effort to set a firm
date for the meeting with Brian Harvey and Prof. Hardyck.

	Adam Glass was appointed "treasurer" and will be responsible
for keeping track of protection money for group accounts, as well
as accounting for the OCF finances, and recording our financies in a
file in /usr/local/OCF/ (specfically, /usr/local/OCF/monies was
suggested).

	Amazingly, the meeting did not dissolve until 8:24pm.
