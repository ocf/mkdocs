There is actually some stuff to discuss here. Let us know what you think
after reading the minutes, yeah?

BoD starts 7:30 PM
Kwinterl wants an RFC system - request for comments
- Can have a formal project for people to tell us what they want or what
we should do, like a proposal.
- Problem - could be easily abused. Make them prove their idea will
work? Discard anything less than 100 words?
GM:
- Lab update: cable networking installation finished in most locations,
faceplates back on, just need some more fiber in a few places. Can have
OCF pre-opening LAN party?
- Techsoup: should we get win2k8 server, vista licenses, office 2007?
-- Can we even run Vista on the Dells? Not really? Should we get new
computers then? But if we buy new computers, they should already have
Vista, so should we still buy licenses?
- We have 30 network drops for computers, so we should have 22 windows
machines. We can buy both new computers and Vista licenses, since the
licenses are only $10 each for Vista Business upgrade.
- Get quotes for 14 thin clients/small-form or 10 to 12 mid-tower
desktops, then go from there.
- Xerox: free Phaser color printer, more efficient, less toner, but you
have to buy minimum amount of supplies/toners every month. Problem is
you have to print minimum pages every month, but what happens during
breaks?
-- Too much of a hassle or not? The Phaser is only $900.
-- Geo: OH GOD XEROX?!?!?!?
SM:
- Met with CalBand people, they want something like 26 group accounts.
They want every band section to have their own page section and be able
to edit it. They're not an OSL registered group, think they're a
departmental group.
- Jameson motions to deny calband more than 1 group account, seconded by
kwinterl. 5 for, 0 against, 1 abstain.
- Www -> ocf.berkeley.edu redirect instead of page telling people to click.
-- Jameson: we should change the docs.ocf to redirect to wiki also,
since there's no docs.ocf
BoD ends 8:10 PM
