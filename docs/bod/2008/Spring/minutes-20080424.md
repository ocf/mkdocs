GM Agenda:

* ASUC Eshleman move deadline accelerated to July 1st
- The bill: http://www.asuc.org/documentation/view.php?type=bills&id=1198
- OCF was not warned about this
- The problem: unfeasible, the new room isn't ready for the servers
- Need six months?
- gordeon will show up at next ASUC meeting on Wednesday and talk to Fullmer

* IST Authentication
- How do we propose we handle this?  Probably better to offer a solution 
to IST first.
- need to talk to CSUA & IST about DNS

* Accessibility
- kwinterl wrote a draft for appeals
- sle and gordeon just appealed for more money (printer) last Monday
- will postpone this b/c ASUC does not give out money easily
