Board of Directors electronic voting on July 31, 2013.
All board members included in request for votes by email. Motion
required agreement from majority of board members (5 out of 8) to
pass.

Directors who participated:
Dara Adib (daradib)
Nader Morshed (morshed)
Raphael Townshend (raphtown)
Sanjay Krishnan (sanjayk)
Timothy Zhu (tzhu)

Dara - Allocate up to $100 to register a non-berkeley.edu domain.

Dara - The university's DNS policy is changing and becoming more
restrictive because the university considers berkeley.edu to be
their trademark. I think we should have an alternate domain as a
long-term backup.

Dara - In the meantime, we could point it at death, for a shorter
URL that gets rewritten to www.ocf.berkeley.edu.

Dara: yes
Nader: yes
Raphael: yes
Sanjay: yes
Timothy: yes

Motion passed.
