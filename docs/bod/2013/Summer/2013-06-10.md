Dara - Allocations are limits on maximum spending, not estimates.

Dara - (1) Motion to increase allocation for gigabit managed switches
from $700 to $3,000. TechSoup qualification did not go through so we
will have to pay full price for a gigabit managed switch.

Dara: yes
Nader: yes
Nicole: yes
Paulina: yes
Raphael: yes
Sanjay: yes
Timothy: yes

Dara - (2) Motion to increase allocation for hypervisor server from
$3,000 to $6,000. We have more funds because the chairs purchase is
not happening this year. I don't think a cheap server is
cost-effective for us because of the overhead of the chassis,
motherboard, power supplies, etc. Although the hypervisor is currently
intended for development ("hoser") virtual machines, it may be
repurposed later for production (likewise, a production server may
become development). This would give us funds for a decent RAID
controller (like our other servers) and a better processor.

Dara: yes
Nader: yes
Nicole: yes
Paulina: yes
Raphael: yes
Sanjay: yes
Timothy: yes

Dara - (3) Motion to allocate $700 for a network interface to our existing UPS.

Dara: yes
Nader: yes
Nicole: yes
Paulina: yes
Raphael: yes
Sanjay: yes
Timothy: yes

Dara - (4) Motion to allocate $650 for an additional Opteron 6272
processor in pandemic hypervisor/disk array.

Dara: yes
Nader: yes
Nicole: yes
Paulina: yes
Raphael: yes
Sanjay: yes
Timothy: yes

Dara - (5) Motion to allocate $100 for 10 wired optical mice. We
already bought 5 x Logitech M100, we would buy 10 more to keep the lab
consistent.

Dara: yes
Nader: no
Nicole: yes
Paulina: yes
Raphael: yes
Sanjay: yes
Timothy: yes

All five motions passed.
