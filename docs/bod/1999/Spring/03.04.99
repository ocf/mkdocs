II. Reports

	General Manager

	The General Manager talked to the ASUC Elections Chair.  She is
	planning to go with the Housing and Dining plan, but has not yet
	confirmed any details and has not yet given us a clear idea of
	what she wants from the OCF.  She will speak with Housing and Dining
	to see what they will offer.  Jen asked Richard to specifically
	make clear that the OCF will not provide any machines besides the
	server.  The OCF may need to assign one person as a contact person
	and a person to teach polling personnel how to operate the software.

	The GM also found a picture of our lab on the front page of the 
	Heuristic Squelch.

	Richard sent in the budget, and will mail out to BoD the final numbers.
	He tried to file it online this year, but the web page was broken.

	Richard also called the Sun representative, who claimed that she
	did not receive his Email requesting quotes.  He sent her another
	Email and said that gm@ocf should be receving the quote by next
	week.

	Richard has not yet talked to Lavonia but will make an effort to
	contact her via phone or in person this week.

	Site Manager

	The SM reported that it has been a fairly quiet week.  Staff caught
	a couple of accounts running ufsrestore.  Conquest lost the ability
	to have network traffic with OCF hosts and had to be rebooted.  We
	have a new staff member.

III.  Old Business

	Purchases

	Jen and Alan brought more prices for consideration.  They found more
	prices for CD-RWs and scanners.  Alan suggested that the OCF buy
	more paper for the printer, but Kat said to check the filing cabinet
	for more.

	Jen also suggested that we contact IS&T about StarOffice.  There have
	been some messages regarding UCB purchasing the site license for the
	software.  Richard will mail Bob Calloway to ask for more information,
	but will send a copy of the draft letter to bod for approval.

IV.  New Business

	General Meeting

	Richard suggested that the OCF have its second general meeting before
	the spring break.  There was general consensus.

	Reregistration

	Jen asked Kat about reregistration, which has not yet been done.  We
	are currently behind schedule on reregistration.  Kat will contact
	or will have someone contact IS&T to discuss options for this year's
	reregistration.
	
	
The meeting was closed at 5:56 pm.
