II. Reports

	General Manager
	
	The GM faxed in the license agreement for Solaris source code.
	Is the GM allowed to sign it?
	
	Site Manager
	
	The SM reports that it has been a busy week.  She and Luns
	brought up catacylsm.  Also took apart headcrash to find out 
	why the display was not working properly.  Death crashed, due
	to numerous ftp sessions that did not die properly.  Death
	was rebooted.  Luns started rereg without notice, and it was
	a surprise to everyone.  So the SM turned it off.  The SM
	reports that we will do rereg next fall, since it is too late
	in the semester to start now.
	
III. Old Business

	Purchases
	
	Richard will go to Costco to buy paper, answering machine, and
	canned air.  Need to buy the CD writer, since we alredy bought
	the SCSI card from Sun.  The Board is leaning towards buying
	the HP Scanner, and Kat mentioned that it was not necessary
	to get the scanning software this year.  No one has looked up
	prices for the UPS or ethernet hub.  Richard will mail Jenni
	to ask for these.
	
	Richard motioned to approve $3,200 for the above purchases. 
	The $3,200 breaks down as follows:
		CD writer		$450 + tax(?)
		Scanner			$392.95 + shipping ($15) + tax(?)
		UPS			$700
		ethernet hub		$300		
		items from Costco	$200
		4GB IBM HDs		$600
		memory			$400
				      ------		
				      $3,200

	Kat seconded the motion.  4-0-1.  Motion passed
	
	Richard will hopefully send out the purchase order on Monday
	or Tuesday.				      
		        
IV. New Business

	ASUC.org
	
	Kat has talked a little with Rishi.  The OCF may co-locate their
	server, but not responsible for the content.  Rish has agreed to
	give us the sys admin stipend (to buy a new server) in exchange.
	The Board decided to to hold another BoD meeting (before the 
	FiComm meeting on Wednesday) to discuss	this further.  The 
	meeting will be next Tuesday, May  4, 1999, at 5pm at at a
	location TBA.  Richard will post the location when he finds out
	what room he can reserve.
	
The meeting was closed at 5:45pm.
