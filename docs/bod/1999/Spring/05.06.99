II. Reports

	General Manager
	
        The GM reports that he and Kat attended the FiComm meeting
	and it went well.  Buy.com now has different prices listed
	since the last meeting.  The current expected expenditure 
	for the items is now ~$1,600.
	
	Site Manager
	
 	The SM reports that the items ordered from Sun have arrived.
	There were a few minor problems in getting them running,
	due to incompatibility of cable types.
	
III. Old Business

	Purchases
	
	The Board had originally looked into buying HDs for some
	of the Sparc Classics we have.  Luns mentioned that we can 
	actually set up the machines to boot off the network, so
	we would not need the drives.  He suggested putting the money
	into buying Fast-Wide SCSI cards instead.  As for memory,
	he suggested going to memoryx.com, since that's where we
	bought before.  Richard agreed to look into prices for the 
	SCSI card and memory.  Luns also said he saw FDDI cards
	being advertised in a newsgroup for $35.  They allow for
	100Mbits/sec transfer rate, and maybe we will want them
	for the machine room.

	ASUC.org

	Rishi Chandra, ASUC Executive Vice President, has not yet
	submitted the list of ASUC's needs to us.  The Board
	cannot make a decision without this information.  

IV. New Business

	Summer Board and next year

	We need to work on recruiting members of the Summer Board.
	Richard stresses that we need to be productive in
	advertising--getting new users, and getting new staff.
	He also suggested we install all the new items that we
	purchased (such as the multimedia station) and promote
	them.
	Kat reports that next year the OCF may have to move to 
	a room on the 5th floor of Eshleman, closer to the front 
	of the hallway.

The meeting was closed at 5:35pm.
