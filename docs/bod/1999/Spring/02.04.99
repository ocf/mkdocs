REPORTS

GM:  Promised to speak with the press about the SM's report.

SM:  We had a cracker break OCF security over the weekend.
     Apparently a hole in one of the Solaris file allowed
     him to gain root level access at least two times before
     a sniffer process was caught.  After reloading the
     OS, security was again breached, but after a second
     OS reinstall, the hole was fixed, and there have been
     no further break-ins.  Approximately 200 accounts were
     sorried as a result of the sniffer.


ELECTIONS

dunnthat was nominated for the position of GM and was elected
with a vote of 5-0-2.  After some discussion, katster was
nominated for SM, and was elected 6-0-1.  tee and jentsoi
promised to fill various roles under the SM.
