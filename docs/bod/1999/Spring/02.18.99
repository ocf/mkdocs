II. Reports

	General Manager

	The GM put together a budget proposal for ASUC funding.  (See New
	Business)

	Site Manager

	The SM reports that this past week has been a slow week.  Jenni
	reported that she brought 8 machines and 8 SCSI cables to the OCF,
	some with hard drives and some with RAM.  There is a possibility of
	the OCF obtaining approximately 20 Sparc 2s, IPXs, and Classics and
	also 2 or 3 monitors.  Physically moving the machines may require
	some expenditure for truck rental.

III.  Old Business

	IMAP

	Richard asked Kat if she had looked into whether the IMAP server
	were up or down.  She had not.

IV.  New Business
	
	Virtual Hosting

	Nathan Kruger from the Renter's Legal Assistance wishes to get a
	new domain, rentersassistance.org, and would like to have it point
	to their OCF web site.  Jenni pointed out that the RLA would have 
	to pass such a request to IS&T to clear it before we could set it
	up.

	The Board discussed virtual hosting on general principle and also
	discussed various options for virtual hosting, whether we should
	perform it transparently, only have URL redirection, or whether
	to just require a banner.  The BoD discussed technical implementation
	and whether it were possible to give out *.ocf.berkeley.edu domains.

	The Board drafted the following policy:

	"The OCF will perform virtual hosting for OCF group accounts.  The
	 group account must A) pay any and all fees and/or obtain the
	 permission involved in obtaining and maintaining a domain name,
	 B) apply to IS&T for a *.berkeley.edu domain, and/or C) apply to
	 OCF Board of Directors for a *.ocf.berkeley.edu domain.  The web
	 page will contain the OCF banner, which may not be removed.  In the
	 case of removal, OCF reserves the right to terminate virtual hosting
	 services with one warning.  The OCF reserves the right to terminate
	 services with one week Email notice."
	
	Elaine made a motion to approve, Kat seconded.  6-0-0, motion passed.

	Budget

	The GM brought in a draft that requested $12,000 from the ASUC.  After
	some discussion, it was decided to request $15,000.  Richard motioned
	to approve a budget based on the same numbers as last year's budget 
	request.  The motion passed, 6-0-0.

	ASUC Elections

	Jenni asked if anyone had talked to the ASUC regarding the upcoming
	ASUC elections.  Richard volunteered to look for the name of the 
	Elections Chair.  Elaine volunteered to talk to the Elections Chair
	if it were one of her classmates.

	Purchases

	Richard reports that we have a little over $9,000 left in the budget,
	and started reading off a list of possible purchases, which included
	a hub, answering machine, UPS, power strips, files, lockdown kits,
	fire extinguishers, a tape autoloader, disks, hard drives, and CD-RW.
	Jenni had looked into prices for some of the equipment, so the Board
	prioritized the list and came up with a list of what to get firm
	price quotes.

	Consensus was reached to get quotes for the DDS autoloader, the
	multipack hard drive, a UPS, an answering machine, and a CD-RW.  All
	approximate prices included generous amounts for shipping.  Any 
	leftover funds can be used to buy file folders, power strips, and
	lockdown kits.  Jenni requested that Richard ask Lavonia Wade in the
	Student Affairs office if extinguishers could be supplied by the 
	university.
	
The meeting was closed at 6:30pm.
