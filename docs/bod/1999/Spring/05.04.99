II. Reports

	General Manager
	
        The GM reports that after talking to Lavonia, he found out
	that the OCF does not have to turn in the receipts for
	purchases until the end of May.  He also went to buy.com
	to check out the items the OCF is planning to purchase.
	Richard took a look at the following items:
		UPS from APC		$750.00 one (suggestion from Jenni)
		CD Burner  	       ~$300.00
		HP ScanJet 6250CXI	$378.00
	The total comes to $1,524.85 + $62.76 shipping		
	Since all the items are in-stock, Richard will generate the
	purchase order and buy these items.
	Regarding 4GB HDs that the Board also wanted to buy:
	There were no SCSI HDs less than 9GB in size on buy.com; if
	we want them, we can look for them elsewhere.
	Richard has not yet gone to Costco to buy the paper,
	answering machine, and canned air.  He will try to go tomorrow.
	
	Site Manager
	
 	The SM reports that she and Luns have looked for memory prices.
	Luns says memory is expensive now.  The 16MB parity 72-pin
	simms run for about $48.00 now, when they used to be $20.00
	not too long ago.  Kat attended the CSUA politiburo meeting,
	and they asked her if the OCF would want any more working
	Sparc 1s.  Luns said we have the memory for them, and so
	Elaine suggested that we accept them to replace the DECs.
	Other events that occurred: rebooted avalanche; got people
	working on the DECs; looked at the ASUC.org machine  They
	found out that ASUC.org is a Pentium 100Mhz, dual, running
	Windows NT 4.0
	
III. Old Business

	Funding
	
	Richard asked if it is necessary for the OCF to be present
	at the FiComm meeting.  Elaine answered that it was not
	absolutely necessary, but is a good idea, since we are
	getting a lot of funding from the ASUC.  Richard wanted
	to know what topics to bring up at the meeting, and Elaine
	suggested that we reiterate to the ASUC the valuable
	services we provide to the campus community (network
	services, email, web space for student group webpages) and 
	why we need the funds.  Richard and Kat will represent the 
	OCF at the FiComm meeting tomorrow.
	
	ASUC.org

	Rishi Chandra, ASUC Executive Vice President, was in
	attendance and answered questions the Board had regarding 
	the OCF becoming the sys admin of ASUC.org  Rishi began
	by saying how difficult it has been to find qualified and
	dedicated people to keep up the ASUC.org  They have also
	allocated funding for two costs--new sys admin, and new
	server.  Since the OCF is also in the building, he believed
	that we could help each other out--the OCF helps by
	maintaing the server, and the ASUC in return could increase
	our funding.
	The Board's main concern was: what does ASUC.org serve?  Is
	it only a web server, or does it serve other things?
	Rishi answered that in addition to the web server, the
	ASUC.org machine also serves as the print server for the
	entire second floor of Eshleman.  Additionally, it serves
	the IP addresses for the second, third, fourth, and fifth
	floors.  The new ASUC sys admin would also ideally be
	responsible for redesigning and maintaining the ASUC.org 
	webpages.
	Rishi agreed to give us a written list of their needs, which
	would facilitate us being able to decide what the OCF can
	and cannot handle.  Things that the Board will continue to
	consider are issues regarding network security, how we would
	ensure this security, and whether we would be asked to do
	things beyond our bounds, knowledge base, and skills.  Rishi 
	will consult with Conor Moore (new incoming EVP) and 
	Biko Allen (current ASUC sys admin) and	email this list 
	to sm@ocf  Members of the sm mailing list agreed to forward 
	this to bod@ocf as soon as they receive it.
		
IV. New Business

	There was no new business.

The meeting was closed at 6:10pm.
