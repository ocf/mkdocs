II. Reports

	General Manager

	The GM talked to Lavonia this past week.  Our current budget contains
	$11,866.48.  The phones have been paid through December, so we have
	at least $11,000 to spend.

	Richard also typed up old minutes, so we should be caught up.

	The OCF has been invited to send a representative to the ASUC Election
	forum.  Richard asked for volunteers.  No one volunteered at the
	meeting, so Richard will ask for other volunteers.

	Site Manager

	The Site Manager reports that it has been a slow week, primarily
	because of midterms.  Alan did some patches, but they still need to
	be finished.

III.  Old Business

	Egg Bots
	
	Kat and Luns have talked a little about egg bots and have a rough
	policy, though nothing has been written out.  Richard asked the two
	to bring in a policy to the next Board of Directors meeting.  There
	was some discussion about the egg bot policy.
	
	Reregistration
	
	Kat will work out something this week.  Elaine reports that she
	wrote an Email to Saar but did not receive an answer.
	
	Purchases

	The price quote that we received from Hector.  The total came up
	with $6606, or $7151 after tax.  Giving a generous amoung for
	shipping, Richard moved that the General Membership approve $7300
	to purchase the items that were listed on the form, which were as
	follows:
