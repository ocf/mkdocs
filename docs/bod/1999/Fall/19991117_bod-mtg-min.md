I. SM Report (by katster)

	Much was donated, Barrows is a mess; some improvements happened.
	-War (the mailserver) has another CPU
	-a global /ocf/tmp may be created with the donated hardware.
	In addition:
	-Death (the webserver) is scheduled to get a new disk (for ASUC)

	"Academics comes first," so akopps will be interim SM 'til I get
	my act together."
	-Kat, who just missed 3 weeks of school due to illness.

II. GM Report

	-The new lab is coming along.
	-The IE jobsfair has been cancelled.

III. Old Business

	Ivan stopped in to gently remind us that we have agreed
	to host an online used book trading/selling zone.
	The idea:  A book exchange bazaar, anything functional by finals
			would be good.
	-Ken reported that he had looked into some solutions available
	on the web.
	-jones and smcc reported that they are working on getting php
	working.

IV. New Business

	kennish's friend's account - kennish has a friend that will help
	him with his online help project.  She isn't/wasn't a cal student,
	so has no right to an OCF account.  The BoD was asked to make a
	decision on this.  The BoD deemed this ok, and stipulates that 
	kennsih will have to vouch for her again at the next rereg.
	Motion to allow kennish's friend an account per above stipulation
	moved by smcc, passed unanimously.

Meeting closed at 6:00pm PST.
