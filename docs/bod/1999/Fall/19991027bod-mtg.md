  what is allowed/disallowed
  discussion (Luns):
   -screen. xbiff. okay
   academically okay
   -rc5/seti - outside effort, not okay, unless a user wrote it and it has
    background priority settings and is not run on all machines
   -all else at SM Discretion
   -eggbot (pingstorm security issues), bnc (irc proxy), but make the BGP 
    policy _general_
   server procs should not be under 'outside' control.
    except tinkering w/ client/server stuf, but this is not 24/7 
    (b/c of its inherent 'testing' nature)
   survival of unattended server processes at discretion of SM, but
   see guidlines online.
   tabled.
