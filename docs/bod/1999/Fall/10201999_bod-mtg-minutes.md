III. Old Business    

	- Startup Jobs Fair -- will fund staff social
	- Staff Social moved to Sunday due to football game	        
        
IV. New Business

	1. New Policies

	  Luns
		they are flawed but username policy is more evil than
		games policy. 
		Username policy - makes more work for us for security,
		doesn't give users any extra abilities that they don't
		already have.
	  Kat
		everybody else (csua, eecs) has a real name-based policy
	  Devin, Suzie
		Names can now use #'s which is okay, and people want an
		alias across services (ie, uclink4, hotmail, ocf, et al)
	  Steve C
		Name/email choice --> for user anonymity, privacy.
	  Devin
		Doesn't make much more admininstration difference if names
		are based on real name or not.
		Since we have allowed name changes in the past, we should
		revise our policy now to only allow name changes to names
		that are based on realnames -to avoid people asking for
		frivolous name changes.
	  Kat
		We have quorum. [implication: can vote on policies]
	  Note: Will revisit this topic next week.

	2. ITA colocation
	ITA needs to talk at a BoD mtg, and additionally we don't
	currently have a free "net tap" (physical eth0 port), that having been
	given to Mars 2012 and the guy who asked for that hasn't used it yet 
	for several weeks now [implication: maybe he never will?].

	3. ITA partnerships

	  Devin
		ITA's members would use our training. Question is, will
		they want to fundraise for OCF next year like Ken and I have
		this semester.  Do we want to involve them in our
		fundraising efforts?
	  Kaliya
		They put on workshops for mostly business students. They 
		have a very different culture (than OCF). Corporate.
	  Devin
		They have memberships charges. If we give them training,
		and some of their members were interested in working on 
		OCF projects, that would be good. 
		Method: by turning people from basic UNIX
		lusers into sys admins in 8wks via weekly courses, and
		also by them installing Linux at home.
		HTML-based training would be good, in general, for anyone.
	  Kaliya
		Business (Haas) has good computer resources.
	  Devin
		Buildling relationships is good.
	  Akop
		Why not do this with CSUA ppl?
	  Kaliya
		CSUA and ITA cater to niches. We are general and IT skills are
		important in today's society, so OCF is a safe place for
		anyone to learn them.
	  Chalkboard
		Staff: sys admin training, for long=term OCF health
		CSUA Help Sessions: HTML, CGI, UNIX use, programming

	3. Heller Lounge Project
	  Devin
		Funding: ASUC, us, EECS, our career fair fundraisers.
		Costs go for infrastructure: elec, net, moving walls, new
		comps, furniture. EECS is excited about it. Thus, they can
		pay for infrastructure and get 8-10 reserved comps for 2-3
		years. EECS students: jammed labs, and students want
		one/some on SouthSide so they don't have to walk
		across scary campus at night.  Negotiations are underway
		I'll keep you updated.

	4. Future Fundraising
	  Devin
		IT/Information Economy career fair - Dec 1st. 
		Will need people to work it, and we will come up with
		specific tasks that people can do. Donations: with the
		influx of money in the future, we can do a lot more as
		OCF, such as: scholarships, tech training for low income
		ppl, philanthropy work, etc.
		i.e. we can adopt a Sourcechange.com model - like
		Mini-Grants. Projects looking for money and vice-versa.
		OCF can put the tasks that we want done online, and 
		capable students can earn some cache by helping us 
		maintain our system and implement new services.  Also
		students that have their own opensource projects that 
		might benefit campus can ask us to fund their efforts.
		also Work, ie ASUC and Superb stipends -- paying our
		people who put in lots of work. 
	  Katrina
		This could be used for enforcing staff hours.
	  Other
		GIMP-like projects

	5. Random SM allocation
		$1000 for cables/etc on the fly. Eugene moved to vote on it,
		Ken seconded. Passed 3-0-2. [2 abs: Luns, Kat, as SM's
		they can't vote.]
