What happened
-------------
Adam Richter gave the General Manager's report, discussing the events of his
term for those who didn't make the Board meetings.  He announced that due to
his imminent graduation, this General Meeting would have the additional
responsibility of choosing his successor.
 
Interim Site Manager Alan Coopersmith reported that the only thing of
interest that happened during his one week term was the unexplained erasure
of about half of lightning's hard disk.
 
The meeting then proceeded to elections to replace the resigned Site Manager
(Roy Rapoport) and the graduating General Manager (Adam Richter), with terms
for each office lasting until the regular Fall 1992 elections.
 
			Site Mgr.			General Mgr.
			---------			------------
Candidates:		Cynthia Leigh Haynes		David Friedman
			Rob Menke			Jon Blow
			Roy Rapoport			Eric Hollander
 
Roy Rapoport was (re-)elected Site Manager and David Friedman was selected
to become General Manager at the end of Spring Semester.
