GM Report:
	Adam reported that he will be meeting with reps from Hewlett-Packard
	on April 15 to discuss extending the service contract and possible
	donations.  According to the figures he received, an on-site service
	contract will cost around $36,000/year, much beyond the wildest
	dreams of our budget.

	Vice-Chancellor Russ Ellis has some plans for public use computing
	facilities.  Adam is trying to get the OCF involved in future
	planning for campus computing and is in the process of preparing to
	make a presentation to the Campus Computing Policy Board [I don't
	know what the exact title is, but the abbreviation is a bunch of C's
	followed by a P.B.]

	Adam is working on trying to implement CMU's Andrew Toolkit on the
	OCF.  Details on how borken of an implementation apollo's can run
	will come as soon as he finishes...

SM Report:
	Roy was notably absent, but Alan reported on behalf of staff that
	earthquake's hard disk ate itself, asked for a "Qualified Apollo
	Technician" and was therefore given to the appropriate people in
	Workstation Support for shipping to HPollo.

Old Business:
	NONE

New Business:
	NONE

Other Useful Things Done:
	NONE
