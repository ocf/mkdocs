Open/Close
    - MCC staff have been opening OCF back door during special
events regardless of wheterh staff are in

    - Three options:
        1) close all time
        2) open all time
        3) open for staff only, responsible for watching users
            - problems
                - how do they tell who's staff

If you're in lab when they close, you can say you'll stay and watch
users, prop door.
- kick everyone out when you'r done!  give warning

Frank will tell Xavie we're using option #3

Lavonia wants In/out sign, users keep harassing MCC staff.

dima: no one will use the sign
did lavonia insist?

frank+jkit: if lavonia wants us to do it, we should do it.
If you don't want to flip the sign for yourself, you don't have to.

We need a big sign/brochure tell A) desk staff != ocf staff
b) how to get started, get an account
