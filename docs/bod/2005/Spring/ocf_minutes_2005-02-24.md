ALIENWARE AND GAMING CENTERS

- Possible option of being responsible for maintaining gaming systems
  and servers

- Fullmer wants to know if we're interested

- We want to know how long it will be until the gaming computers are
  released to us for general OCF use.  (We'd probably get them,
  eventually).

- Will anyone use these machines?

- jkit: Fullmer told me the machines would get re-imaged nightly,
  making maintenance much easier.

- Frank: Fullmer will come to the meeting next week and get the
  details.

- Consensus: We're interested in hearing more but don't want to commit yet.

----------------------------------------

SCREENSAVER ADVERTISEMENTS

- For local businesses

- Do we want to do this?

- (General objections ensue)

- Aoshi: ASUC won't like it

- Frank: Is it feasible?  Answer: yes

- Could we advertise for student groups?

- Taking money in general is bad.

- Doing stuff for community in general is good.

- Desktop background vs. screensaver

- Is desktop background locked?  Answer: no

  break.

NETWORK OUTAGE MORNING OF 2/19/2005

- geo + dwc fixed it.

- CNS had something go wrong in Sproul Hall

----------------------------------------

7TH FLOOR ESCHLEMAN COMPUTERS

- Dima + Yury + Frank + Matt formatted the machines, installed WinXP
  SP2, Symantec Client Security, Video Drivers, Firefox

  - These are web browser only stations, as publication wants.

  - mattfong: Kiosk mode is harder than previously thought.
    Running/booting/installing off CD works.

    - Would knoppix work for this?

- Networking for these machines is handled by Fullmer(?)

- General/general is disabled

  - Should we enable it?

- There is a nonstandard windows admin password.

- Leftmost system is locked with an unknown masterlock lock

  - Worst case, bring it to jkit with the serial number

PRINTER was wrinkling pages...Dima magically fixed it.

HACKED ACCOUNT

- dwc fixed it

----------------------------------------

SPAMILTER

- Dima told jjlin the spamilter was spitting out error messages

  - jjlin fixed it.

- No one talked to Luns :(

  - Aoshi will talk to Luns.

----------------------------------------

DOWNTIME BACKUP SYSTEMS WITH CSUA

- We want to set up a system where if OCF goes down, CSUA will pick up
our traffic, mail, etc.  and vice versa.

- It shouldn't be a problem handling our amount of traffic.

----------------------------------------

ACCOUNT APPROVAL

- Make sure the user's middle name is on the account and account form

----------------------------------------

DUPLICATE ACCOUNT CHECKING

- Can we use student IDs (SIDs) for this?

- Are SIDs recycled?

- Is there a secret CalNet fingerprint beyond just the SID?

- Can we use hashing, to store a SID hash instead of the SID itself?

- We don't even need to associate SID (or hashed SID) with an a given
account, we just need to keep the (hashed) SIDs in a giant list, and
check to see whether the new SID (hash) is already in the list.  This
will work for duplicate checking.

----------------------------------------

INTERIOR DECORATING: Do we want posters?

----------------------------------------

BERKELEY MODEL UNITED NATIONS (BMUN)

- Frank: They're not getting the final agreement until they sign the
wage agreement.  $120 for 7.5 hours of service

- We need to set up the appropriate accounts

- With arbitrary print quota (they are supplying paper and toner).

----------------------------------------

TONER

- mattfong: we're currently getting toner at discount prices via my
  employee discount.  It's only $20 off per unit, but I'll be
  graduating soon.

----------------------------------------

BACKUP/REDUNDANT HARDWARE: We don't have any, there will be problems
if things fail.

----------------------------------------

OCF LAPTOP AREA:  Do we want one?

----------------------------------------

LONG TERM DIRECTION FOR OCF

- What is our mission?

- What are our priorities?

- Why are we using Solaris?

- Most Sun systems use Sparc

- New Sun stuff uses Opteron
