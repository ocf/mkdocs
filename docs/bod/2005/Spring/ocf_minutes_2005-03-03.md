BUDGET
- Passed around, look at it.
- due tomorrow

BMUN
- general/general
- print quotas removed
- any takers?
- March 11-13
- Dima "we'll handle it"
- Next week we'll schedule volunteers

NEW PASSWORDS
8+ character passwords
SOLARIS 9 or NON SOLARIS
Within next two months

How are we going to enforce the new characters?
Aoshi: "That is the heart and soul of rereg"
jerjou: We can't ignore this issue.

7TH FLOOR ESCHLEMAN
1 system is working with firefox and general login
Want to get Kerberos setup
Those systems aren't getting OCF account access.

CSUA DNS BACKUP, MAIL, WEB
Dima met with them
Eric said he'd help us set it up, and bypass IP caching problem.
Dima will work on that with CSUA

PRINT QUOTA INCREASES
jerjou: current policy is to do it even if it's lame
aoshi: free 100
jkit: give them 1 set of 100, then stop allowing
dima: I've been approving 50 accounts per week (giving away a ton of extra
paper is not sustainable)
brando: maybe 50 pages max, and then after that start looking hard into
their logs, otherwise they are taking care of us.
jerjou: maybe give them 100 unless they have bad attitudes, at which point give them 50
aoshi: free printing is our main thing now, if we start taking away that, we'll start showing up on ASUC's radar.  It's a better idea to just keep us off the ASUC shit list.
jerjou: I don't think it's as much of a problem with resources as much as it is people being rude and mean.
jkit: it's all up to the pimp (adrian)
everyone: WHO'S NOT HERE!
(chatter)
brando: are people starting to go over their quota on purpose?
frank: if it gets overwhelming we'll deal with it later.
brando: give 50 pages to the user in question
jerjou: I think it's already been done.

ASUC ELECTIONS
Angel Brewer is coming at 7:45pm.

- Donation to OCF of $2000 if we do it.
- Looking for 3 to 5 tech managers who'd be compensated individually
  - "hourly wages, I assume"
  - ideally read/coding knowledge, php/mysql, but would not be doing any coding
- Devin Jones is updating tech program
- Patrick Feyh is overseeing manager.
- Assistants are unpaid
- Tech Managers are paid (3 to 5 people)

- Frank: According to Dima's math, it's less than $10/hr
- Aoshi: was it all the time, or just at certain points?
- jkit: I don't think we should push for more money.
- Ryanx: How much is stipend?  Unknown.
- Aoshi: What if we can't supply 5 to 10?  (Will they give us a lesser donation?)
- Frank: At least 5, preferably 10 at the beginning, fewer during the day, 5 to 10 at end of day.

- Brando: Accept or not, don't haggle.
- Geo: If we get a donation, does this affect our budget?  (i.e. does it get cut out of our budget?)
  - Frank: We kind of asked Lavonia about this kind of thing (though she is not the end-all source of knowledge), and she said it's unlikely.

- Frank: "if we say no, I think we're going to get hurt."

NEW SERVER
Brando: As of right now we only have $6k for the rest of the year
- NEED TO PAY FOR
- printer maint
- paper 
- toner
- see below

MOTION 1000 for SM FUND
REJECTED

MOTION 500 SM FUND JKIT
SECOND GEO
UNANIMOUS PASS

So 5500 LEFT FOR PRINTER MAINT/PAPER/TONER
Brando: We're not going to have money left for a server.

PRINTER MAINT
- Paperwork is in hands of Fullmer, might take a while.

NEW SERVER
Brando: From what I'm seeing, it's not going to happen this semester.
I put $12k on the budget for a new server for next year.

Brando: We are getting a lot of new users, our paper usage is rapidly increasing.

Frank: This is all speculation for now.

Somebody: Death is slow.

Aoshi: We can't do much about death right now, ImageMagik w/PHP which is really really slow.

Blade 100 sitting in back not doing anything.  Can we run PHP on an aux server?

Web and MySQL in one is less than ideal.  Offloading one would be good.

SMs have to keep death alive until end of semester.

ASUC ELECTIONS

Angel elections council chair, 3rd year.
Leslie ANn donated $1200 last year for about 10 pepole
This year up to $2000

Apr. 5-7
tu,we,thu

computerized

devin jones is going to update the voting program.  programming side is taken care of.

patrick is going to come on as technical coordinator.  managing everyone.

what we would need are people who could be involved on those three days
9am, so rollout at 5,6am.  first team would have to arrive around that time.

RIde in vans to each polling site.
building ops drops off tables/chairs

OCF people just have to set up computers.
It's really easy.

Hotspot of the day will be then.

All 11 sites need to be up by 9am.

>From 10am to 2 or 3pm we only need a few people to stay with us in Eschleman HQ.
That is the lull time.

ResHall Dining Hall open at 4:30.  Similar size team as morning need to show up
around 3pm, drop assistants off at Foothill, CLark Kerr, iHouse, etc.

Polls close at 10pm.  Couple of people to pack up, wind cords.

Relatively simply process.

Patrick: It's basic.

Patrick:  It's good to have 10 people, but can probably get by with less.

We do feed you 3 meals if you're there all day.

Patrick: If you're interested, contact me or Angel.

Angel:
There are pollworker positions
8.50 per hour, for sitting at poll station.

OCF people as pollworkers would be even better.

There's a 1 hr. mandatory training.  You get paid for the training too.

5am to 10pm

Angel: Technical managers.  Patrick is working on them.  5 to 6
people.  Last year they called themselves "hacker wrangles."  Those
guys would need to have network security, VPN, system failure skills.
Those people don't necessarily need to be there all day, but need to
be there setup, afternoon and take down.  The flat stipend for tech
managers will be more than sitting around as a pollworker all day.

Patrick: Mostly it's sitting around, every now and then something goes
wrong.  Mostly you press power buttons.

Angels: Problems in the past were mostly programming issues.

Patrick: There have been some hardware problems with routers, wrong
router at wrong station.  ResHall uses specific MAC addresses of
hardware, so if you get the wrong one there are problems.  It's really
not going to tax you.

Frank:  $2k this semester or next?

Angel: I can have it to you even at 10pm on the last night of the elections.

11 sites, 9 close at 4, 2 close at 10 5 off campus sites (reshalls,
etc.) (these open at 4:30, need to be there at 3:00)

Angel: You can study/eat in the lull of the day.

Jerjou: Can we look at the code.

Patrick:  If you want to be involved at that level you can talk to Devin.

FranK: What if only 5 people are there at 5am?

Angel: I'll be very disappointed, but what can I do?  We'd have to
talk about it afterwards.

Patrick:  You'll just have to set up faster.

Angel: Seriously, if you only have 5 people but you can get it done by
9am, that's okay.

Patrick: It doesn't take that long, but if there are problems like the
pollworkers not showing up then you have to sit there and guard the
computers.  It is also hard to locate the ethernet ports sometimes,
but we are trying to take pictures of that and fix it.

asucelection@gmail.com

If you want you can give the ASUC password to Arun, but he doesn't really
 need it. 

BUDGET (CONT.)
mattfong: be more descriptive on the budget, give specifics.

Color laser printer?!

NEW SERVER
To be dealt with later

ALIENWARE Probably not alienware.

If anybody, it's going to be ACER.  Keeping computers or not depends
upon what we negotiate with them.  Everything's going to be free.
Bearcade is doing poorly, so Fullmer wants to set up 4 systems in
Bearcade, (2 computers in bear's lair?)  (some in reshall?) free
accounts for students, OCF would set up servers and get privileges.
Donated games from EA.  We pay nothing.  It's just a time committment.
It's a back burner non-time critical issue.  If it does well, then
ASUC AUX will want to take over, we might get a percentage.  We get
free acounts, and admin on server.  We'll keep on running it, even
after ASUC AUX takes over money.  The computers would need internet
access out.  Server we would be running would be open to the world.

Mattfong:  Computer available to outside world would be less secure.  

Nobody cares, nothing important will be on the server.

Frank: You'd have to be serious to sit around and deal with it. Time
committment?!

Frank: Unless there's material gain for OCF as an organization, it'd
have to be an individual project.

Patrick:  If fullmer's in charge it probably won't get done super fast.  

Aoshi:  This isn't actually related to anything in the OCF's mission statement.

SPAMILTER/SENDMAIL/POSTFIX
jerjou
- We need to fix sendmail to conform with new security standards
- jjlin thought postfix would be better
- but we have a ton of hax for sendmail, I think for the purposes of spamilter
cpfeyh:  what happened to luns?
geo: he's not on the postmaster alias.
jkit and cpfeyh: (shows worship for luns' amazing hacking on sendmail)

cpfeyh: he's willing to help, but he just can't do it alone any more.
he did for 6 or 7 years alone, only recently have jeremy and derek
picked it up

mattfong: spamilter is currently down, so while that's happening, we
might as well switch to postfix?

cpfeyh: luns is really nice and good to learn from
jkit: akop knows sendmail

jerjou: postfix is better, sendmail is very very hacky
aoshi: postfix is much much cleaner
jerjou: any objections to moving to postfix?

jkit: no moral objection, just "do you have the know-how?"
jerjou: I can probably do it.

NIS+ TO LDAP

Aoshi: I was talking to the guys at Sun, and there were like "what the
fuck?!" "what the hell is wrong with yalls?!"

jkit: it's no longer supported
cpfeyh: dsrogers was doing a lot of work on it

jerjou: same machines?
aoshi: war's setup as ldap server.  famine's ldap client.
chances are you don't have access to famine.

cpfeyh: what is war *not* doing?

aoshi:  famine mine be broken, you might have to ssh in as root.
since famine is an ultra 1 you probably have no business on it, anyways.
if you want to continue with LDAP, directory file is on war.

the issue then is where you want to run the server.  what's kind of
cool is that once you get LDAP running you can toss any number and
kind of server on there.

we still need samba.

printing goes through samba.

Doesn't have to be done in one go.

Going to have to change a bunch of scripts.

If you're interested, there was work done when drifty was still
around.  There is a python implementation of approve ("approve++ and
extra shit") around.  If you want to hack around on approve and then
deal with dwc and jjlin trying to break your shit and piss you off...


WINDOWS IMAGING

Password for joining domain is right,
but something is not working.  

jkit: I talked to akop, he said talk to Luns.

SERVERS
x86 or Sun?
x86 is a piece of shit and will die regularly
Sun hardware will last forever.

FreeBSD supports Sparc

jerjou: I'm fine w/freebsd

Aoshi: just live way it is

Mattfong: We have to upgrade because of new security reqs

aoshi: go ahead and hack on headcrash.  gentoo's on there now.
jerjou: I can just wipe it?
aoshi: if you really want to, I'd prefer you not.
aoshI: i was working with headcrash and earthquake.

yury: clustering and balancing?

web and login are bitches.

akop's not doing anything right now.

ideally divide the load, virtual server.  it's a pain in the ass.

if anything, split web and mysql servers.

jkit: I was told that mysql has no quota

aoshi: should be in services

YURY

I looked at Ultra 5's, one disk crashed.  What do we do with them?

Maybe a cluster, additional web server.  We have 3.

Aoshi: They are shitty.

Yury: Dima filled up a third of the spare disk on firestorm.

7TH FLOOR

ASUC wants computers.  Dells to ASUC if ASUC stocks Eschleman.  MOU says
ASUC has to work with publications and OCF lends computers.

ASUC has 12 new comps from Dell

Say we need to fix those computers, take them back.

CSUA
dlong: someone is going to contact root@csua, right?
dima: going to talk to eric first...
blah blah blah
