POLICY:
--------------------------------------------------

FLEET

- Non-affiliated person complained and asked for info to be taken
  offline.  Then the person whose info was on the site asked for that
  old info to be taken offline.

- jjlin sorried FLEET

- Dima unsorried FLEET

- Arguments:
  - The guy thought the bio of him was misleading.
  - He has something invested in it, whereas nobody else does?
  - FLEET's gone, no one else can take it down, and there's a request
    for it to be taken down, whereas there's no counter-request for it
    to stay up.
  - It's FLEET's responsibility to get back to us, and they haven't.
  - They're #1 on google.
    - That's doesn't necessarily mean anything.
  - They didn't ask for the entire site to be taken down.
  - It's censorship.
  - There's no security hole.
  - they're not OSL registered
    - but you can't sorry them on a non-registed grounds b/c of it
      would be discriminating against them specifically (while other
      unregistered groups get away with it.)
    - rereg?  not an option

- griffin motions to table
- yury seconds

ACCOUNT NAMES
- Why aren't there arbitrary user names allowed?
  - Doesn't appear to be an explicit reason now, though there may have
    been one in 1989
  - Might not need a reason
  - Precedent/tradition
  - Makes OCF look more professioal
  - Don't want to get into business of judging names
  - 99% of people immediately comply with "has to be based on your
    real name"
  - Why are we more restrictive than CalMail?
  - Run out of namespace?
    - We can make exceptions if people are truly out of namespace
  - Is the purpose to avoid offensive names?
  - Flip the argument, is there any reason why we should allow them anything?
    - (i.e. are they really intrinsically entitled to whatever they want)
  - Can handle on case by case basis?
    - Let SMs handle it
  - Current policy is not well defined.

NETIQUETTE
- jerjou: be nice in e-mails
- jkit: doesn't matter what you say, but how you say it

KEEPING OCF OPEN DURING EVENTS
- Frank/Brando/Dima will talk to publications about keeping OCF open
  during MCL events.


PAPER QUOTA INCREASES
- 2 Schools of Thought:
  1) Let them have it
  2) We are poor, don't let them have it

- Jerjou: Many requests don't even have reasons.
- Adrian: Print logging?
- Novakyu: Most people don't know how to check the queue and their quota

- Adrian: I currently give them 50, and tell them if they need more
  they might need to go to W&MF

- Frank: So agreement, give them 50
  - Jerjou: Even for nontrivial, academic reasons?
  - Brando: Everything else is up to discretion

- [Discussion of how rollovers are difficult]
