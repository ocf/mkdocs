---------------

New/Old Business

Advertising:
    -joshk is gonna say something in CS 61A
    -ASUC plasma screen is avalable to advertise the OCF
    
Card Key:
    -significant financial investment required: certifications, security cameras, upwards to $3000
    -the UCPD has a system but they wouldn't like it, we would have to sign a memorandum of vulnerablity of the fact that we are just leaving it open to a huge amount of people.
    -nova suggests we setup a system where people who want access can ask for it
    -the "multicultural events" seem to be increasing so this may be the best possible solution
    -devon thinks it will be about $8000-$12000 for the entire setup
    -fulmer thinks it will be about $6000, we need at least 2 DVR setup by an approved vendor
    
Dragonfire:
    -gaming cluster in MLK, Tom Cordry has approved it at 0 cost
    -which would involve setting up a few machines in the arcade, a couple in Bear's Lair(with nautical equipment to beer-proof it) and some machines outside the OCF
    -Alienware would be interested in supporting such a project
    -the initial setup would be a free system for UC Berkeley students, and surrounding campuses. the OCF would administer the system, eventually it would be expanded and a cost system would be setup.
    -last year we discussed that the setup would have a large amount setup and maintenance before we saw any profit
    -there is an issue of if it is part of the goal of the OCF
    -once two of the main projects is done there is a general consensus to get involved in it, in one month we will revisit the issue
    
IS Update
    -Auxilary ASUC wants campus minimum standards to be met by all student groups. there is an outside team which is doing an audit, so we need to ensure security
    -over the summer there were security issues
    -CNS/IST pays for bandwidth and if there is a huge amount of load ona subnet then that subnet is shut down, the OCF is only a part of a subnet which includes the ASUC
    -the OCF has a block of IP's and since IP's are static so we can't steal IP's
    -currently we have gigabit, if we flood again we are gonna be dropped down into 10Mbs
    -hmogri does security for a living, we love hmogri
    -jerjou brings up rereg...everyone gasps
    
jkit moves to close, everyone seconds
