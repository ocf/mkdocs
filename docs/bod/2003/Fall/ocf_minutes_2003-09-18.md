Board of Directors Meeting Starts
	(even though it technically could have started earlier
	since quorum had been achieved)
	(quorum = 2/3 of BoD or 5 members,
	whichever is greater)
	(7/8 were present)
	(7/8 > 2/3)

Disk Management
	- Chris Weber (Berkeley Science Review)
		- From the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab
		- is the editor of the Berkeley Science Review (BSR)
		- Wants an OCF account to serve as a document management system
			- system would serve press-ready documents
			for magazine publications
				- i.e. huge, high dpi documents
			- system would need to support uploading
			and editing text and images
			
		- Disk Space Options for Them 
			- 300 megs 
				- do-able but a hassle for them
			- 2 gigabytes to 5 gigabytes
				- What they'd ideally like
		- Our servers are currently running at about 30%
		hard disk capacity, but this is given that very few users
		are taking advantage of their webspace quota.

		- Akop: "Why does this need to be on our webserver?"
			- (as opposed to ftp, etc.)
			- Web interface is ideal for them, publically
			accessable, used by non computer professionals.
		- Are they a legitimate campus organization?
 			- yes, they're a student official publication
		- Are they for profit?
			- doesn't seem like it,
			ad-supported campus publication

		- Will the OCF benefit from giving them an extra-large account?
			- They said they could acknowledge the OCF on 
			"the masthead" 

		- Potential Issues
			- If we give BSR more space, will other people
			demand more space?

			- Who sponsors the BSR?

			- Where would the space go?
				- web interface
					- BSR writes the document management
					software
					- or Devin helps them find some
					open source software.

			- Do we have the server resource?
			(CPU, HD space/bandwidth, network bandwidth)
				- yes

				- if they trash the server resources
				we can limit them

End of Disk Management Section

- Cleaning
	- People are taking over Barrows
		- we have to get our stuff out
	- dungeonous room
		- lots of old records down there we need to clean out
		- postpone discussion until further time
		- discuss this over mailing list
	- equipment
		- old equipment -  whose property, us or ASUC?

- Calendar
	- Sept 26
		- Barrows
	- Sept 27
		- Barrows/OCF Lab
	- Sept 28
		- OCF Lab (and Server Room)

- Old books in bookcase
	- Old and useless?
	- Devin and Akop will handle

- Publicity
	- Tabling
	- E-Mail Spam

- Whom do we want for staff?
	- anyone?
	- only OCF members?

	- Recruit out of computer science classes?
	-Tabling
		- Bem says tabling has worked really well in the past
		- Is anyone willing to table?
			- Will and Adrian free (9/19/03)
			- Patrick and Eleen free for part of time (9/19/03)
	 	- Do we have tabling materials?
			- Devin will make
		- You have to register to table
			- Eleen will register to table 
	- Some people don't know the OCF exists
		- why is why the general public might
		not be such a bad idea, because there
		are just as many informed users out there
		as are already signed up

- Google Groups Message Board
	- ucb.org.ocf

- New Account Creation Process
	- Should we modify the way accounts are made?
		- Current system:
			- any staff can approve
			- once approved, root staff can create the account
		- Why current 2-step process?
			- checks and balance
			- limits people making weird accounts/
			more accounts (eg get around quota)
		- Why change process?
			- Is it for the benefit of the users or
			the benefit of the staff?
				- web based account signup makes it easier
				for users
					- can do it @ any time
					- esp. times without staff
					- avoid losing lab users
					who are disappointed because
					of account creation delay
		- Can we streamline it for a fast process?
			- online approval?
			- have account created as soon as approved
			and then double checked later?
			- via CalNet?
				- Akop
					- some people oppose CalNet
					because it is strict about
					account conventions
				- Patrick
					- what data does CalNet
					allow you to collect or not collect?
		- CalNet
			- Should anyone with a CalNet ID be able to
			get an account?
				- It's possible to get a CalNet ID
				even if you're not student, faculty, staff
			- Calnet IDs don't expire immediately
			- Easier to fake a CalNet ID since someone's
			not sitting there looking at your picture
			- Can we get real info from AWS (CalNet)?
				- No
					- only SID and UID
					- no way to check their
					info, AWS keeps all the info
					except releasing a public
					SID and UID
			- Gabe will look into technical CalNet issues and
			e-mail staff@OCF

- Staff Training
	- Website change
		- project lists
			- what you need to do

		- HOWTOs
		- Devin
			- likes the idea, willing to help
			- doesn't want the project page to be
			on the OCF front page
		- Akop
			- should it be password protected?
			- maybe make TODO list public
			- walkthroughs private

		- Public TODO vs private TODO
		- collect all of the random FAQs scattered around
		the disks

			- files in /home/s/st/staff
				- anyone can add to it

		- use revision version control
