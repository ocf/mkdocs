GM Message:

Ordered 7 boxes of paper.

Apparently we've gone through 4 reams in 1 day recently.

Paper is in the filing cabinet 3rd and 5th drawers.

Filing cabinet key is found and back in lockbox.

Number of requests for paper quota increase is up.

We have an online paper quota increase request form up on the homepage.

Toner is ordered, should be here within a week.

SM Message:

CNS has blocked one of our machines (headcrash) b/c they claim it's infected with a worm
- Headcrash is our ghost server
- Devin is in the process of fixing/repairing/reinstalling.
- Headcrash will be webcam server if he gets it working

Devin did more virtual hosts

Problem with mailman?

Devin's try to keep webteam organized, has been e-mailing people.

Web-team can talk to each other by mailing web-team@OCF

if you want to be on web-team, e-mail web-team@OCF or jones@OCF

--------

Is it possible for us to borrow a dolly to transport paper?
- Room 23: building ops.  They'll let you borrow things.

Devin moved ASUC computers to ASUC, they await free IPs and some network equipment.
- Devin would like to approve SM discretionary fund ($500)
- So Devin can buy things as needed for hardware, doesn't have to come to BoD to approve everything.
- Needed: a switch or two, etc.


E&S finally delivered carts to Barrows
- Akopps will fill them up this week with the hardware we're sending to evans
- Are we throwing away the rest of the equipment in Barrows or what?
     - There's nothing left there
     - There was some Sun software
          -  Akopps already selected the useful software and Patrick grabbed it

- Printer
        - We thought our printer was eating up toner
        - Last week our printer said it had printed 13-14,000 pages in it's life
        - But that's obviously wrong because we went through 35,000 pages of paper last month
        - Jimmy and Eleen did a print test and the page counter was working correctly
                - What can we conclude?  Did someone reset the print count?
        - How much does servicing cost?
                - Akopps: $200-300

------------

- Macs aren't on the domain
- We don't have IPs for Macs

- Printer drivers on Dell don't allow for duplexing

- Someone needs to rewrite the print-acctforms script?
        - This script is really slow, send multiple 1 page jobs.  This takes up a lot of memory

- User suggests we implement a wait-queue for machines
        - Who will enforce?
        - Almost imossible to enforce
        - Vulturing computers

- Can we make the windows machines auto-logout?
- - Complaints about peoples' print quotas, -- it's probably because they left themselves logged in.

Jkit has been working on documentation.
- It's in his home directory
- jkit/ocf

- It would be nice if everyone documented things

Fundraising?  Will probably happen a lot more/better next semester

eScrip didn't come through, due to state budget cuts.
- it's extra hard to do in CA
- They're mainly targeting churches, elementary school and high schools.



 -----------

New Business

Patrick's mentioned (plus users) have mentioned that AC freezes the Dells and doesn't circulate
- We do this because we point it up
- We don't want to blow it directly on the staff at the Sun boxes
- The whole plan for the AC was to cool the server room, but it's not doing that

- To buy parts to reroute cold air to server room requires 2 parts:
- Duct, piper

- rigid pipe
- 24 ft. long
- only 30 degree angle possible?

- Can we rotate the AC 90 degrees (to point at the server room?)

- Atlas equipment sales

Scheduling:
There is one BoD meeting after thxgiving and before finals

- Drilling a hole in the server room wall?

SM Discretionary Fund:
Is this tacitly allowed?
Better to clear with BoD first?
- Devin wants $500?
- (not decided yet)
- geo motions to give $500 to Devin
- sol seconds

- Passes unanimously

We have a little less than $2000 for the year
- We're supposed to get the $1600 from Fullmer and $1000 from ASUC

- Buying RAM for the Dells?
- We have 11 Dells
- Dells are really slow
- Can Devin use some of discretionary action to upgrade Dell RAM?


SSL Certs?
- dwc started looking into free certs
- So Devin stopped.

Socials
- Gunbound (a game we could play)

- Windowmaker still crashes

- Don't let people unplug our machines
- Patrick is supposed to be MAC restricting our switch
- Patrick is busy, not seen in a while.

Is there a security issue with someone plugging into our ports?
- Yes.
- Every single person who's ever plugged into our network has a ton of viruses.
- CNS shuts down our ports.

If anyone asks if we can use digital libraries, say "no."
- our subnet is not considered a campus subnet.
- Library says b/c we are campus subnet, they deny access to proxy
- Patrick said he was going to try to contact the library?
- Should we have someone else follow up on this and bug them a lot?
- Someone should talk to the proxy people.
- We're on the same subnet with DailyCal, as well as eFollet, which is a  corporations.

Virtual hosting personal accounts?
username.ocf.berkeley.edu
- You'd have to build and sync a database every day
- This prevented it in the past
- We don't know what the policy is about the actual hostnames.
- Devin "campus is a little bit snarky about the domains you can set up"
- Unless you're a campus division
- New campus policy: no www. in front of domains
- If we wanted to do this we could, but it'd be a big pain in the ass

Webmail:
- Can we have a subdomain for webmail?
- webmail.ocf.berkeley.edu
- Can we get a new webmail program?
- Squirrelmail isn't great.
- Users don't know how to access their e-mail

jones to mbh:
- Install Firebird as a menu option on blackbox?

Devin: motion to close
Sol: seconds

Meeting ends?
