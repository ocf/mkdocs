** Meeting Minutes **
	*** jkit calls meeting start ***
	*** Air Conditioner (AC) issues ***

			- (this is done, as of later that night)
	*** Preapprove vs. Approve ***
		
		**** Preapprove ****
			- has extra features
				- checks if account exists

		- but you can check these things on your own, too.
	*** Cleaning ***

		- Eleen introduce's Sol's website
			- Redesign of OCF website
			- Organize information so it's more accessible
		- Posted his latest round of stuff to staff e-mail list
		- people should tell them what they want included
	
	*** CalNet Authentication ***
		- Devin attended an info session
			- Gives a mini-lecture here.
		- Our Current System: Account Forms
			- SID - Is s/he a valid Berkeley person?
				- (e.g. student/faculty/staff)
			- Name - verification of identity
			- Signature - a legal formality
			- Photo ID - to make sure name=person

		- CalNet
			- Mechanism
				- Your web page transfers login request
				to CalNet authentication page
				- CalNet Authentication Page
					- Gets SID and password from user
				- If successfully authenticated,
				CalNet sends the following information
				back to your page
					- userID
					- name
					- e-mail
					- student status
				- CalNet does NOT report SID
					- SID+name together
					are either used to verify your
					identity in some places
					or are very close to being
					able to identify you
					and are thus dangerous
					and undesirable to have together
			- What we can do with CalNet
				- Username=login
				- using CalNet ID isn't going to 
				totally eliminate account forms.
				- CalNet hopefully makes account
				signup faster
				- Devin: "up until now we didn't
				know if we could get a constant
				username (as opposed to session ID)
				and/or real name"
					- Now we know we can.
			- Miscellaneous	
				- Akop: How do we prevent
				people who already have OCF accounts
				from double signing up?
					- Do we have a way of checking
					for double accounts with the
					current system?
					- Patrick: rereg
				- Does the constituion say anything
				about only student, faculty and
				staff getting accounts?  Would 
				using CalNet allow inappropriate
				people to get accounts?
				- When do CalNet accounts expire?
					- If CalNet doesn't expire
					immediately, it would allow
					non student/faculty/staff
					to get an OCF account, even
					after they've left.
					- What is our policy on 
					alumni accounts?
				- How would group accounts work?
					- Independently of CalNet
					(paper system).
	*** Class Accounts ***
		- For departments' TAs/classes
		- Devin proposes this new account type
		- Right now
			- we allow students and student groups
			- if a class wants it
				- make sure they have a professor's
				notice
				- ask if they're running class
				continually or just this semester
					- if just this semester,
					put it in their home directory
					- if continually, and/or a huge
					common class, it's okay, give
					them account
				- Who's responsible?
					- usually the head TA
				- Who wants accounts?
					- generally people want the URL
					- redirection?
		- Class Account Prototype
			- no home directory
			- be in a specific place for class accounts
			- whole different style of account
				- take into account history/continuity
				of a class?
					- automatic system to preserve/destroy
					archived semesters, without
					the TA having to deal with managing
					the historical files.
				- Jun: Would we require reregistration
				each semester?
					- Devin: Possibly, but make it
					a very low-hassle procedure for
					the TAs.
		- Since class accounts are new, do we have to change
		our formal written policies?
			- Devin: "I may just do it"
			- Eleen: "Just tell us if you do it"
			- We think Devin can just make the change
			to policy
			- check staff list for objections
			about policy votes?
	*** Rearranging Heller Lab ***
		- Make space for Dells?
		- Moving the book case
			- throw out old books
			- books go to library?
			- store books somewhere
				- only post a paper list in the common
				space, so as to save space in the lab
		- Add a table under the whiteboard?
			- Talk to building operations
			- Do we need a table?
				- Ostensibly using it for laptops
		- Devin wants a row of UNIX machines
		- The masses want Windows
		- Remove Hurricane?
		- There's currently no room to use the iMac
		- Put the Macs next to each other?
		- Arrange the tables in a "doughnut" (donut?) in the center
		of the room?
		- No money for desks
		- Geo suggests use Keyboard/Video/Mouse(KVM) switches
		between Sun and Windows boxes so that you can
		switch between them without taking up extra desk space
			- e.g. the Sun only row can be converted
			to Windows by flipping a switch
				- (you need functional windows computers
				hooked up alongside the Sun boxes
				but don't need a spare monitor, keyboard,
				mouse, because they're shared)
		- E-mail staff@ocf with ideas
		- Extending current desks?
	*** Fund Raising ***
		- Patrick:
			- Renting out our space
			- Provide support for meetings
		- Akop:
			- Provide pre-setup systems for meetings?
				- (As opposed to having to deal
				with configuring other peoples' stuff)
		- What kinds of services can we provide?
			- Games Night
				- problems:
					- need licensed games
		- Last year OCF people got paid to do the
		electronic ASUC election
			- It was a huge project
			- Maybe OCF can get involved as an organization
			- Even if we don't donate the individual
			voting stations, maybe we can provide
			the server work they need.
				- Staff wouldn't have to work
				the voting stations, either.
	*** ASUC Mini-Computing Center ***
		- ASUC wants a small general use office on the
		second floor of Eshleman, behind the ASUC offices.
		- We could make a satelitte OCF space in there
		with our extra Dells
		- Issues
			- It'd be a pain for them to come down to
			us in Heller Lab to get support/sign up for
			accounts
			- We have a mailbox in Eshleman
				- Akop: but nobody checks it
				- but Karl Chen (login:karlchen) is already
				in charge of working with ASUC
		- ASUC Senate Meetings
			- every Wed. 7pm...sometimes lasting until 4am
