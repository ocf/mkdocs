GM Message:
  - Eleen went to an ASUC meeting last night, where a bill was passed
    granting the OCF $867.  An additional $133 of the money cut from
    the original budget will be refunded, for a total of $1,000.

  - Please use Elliots Wiki page.  It has lots of useful information,
    and is easily edited.


SM Message:
  - On Tuesday, Devin approved all of the pending virtual host
    requests.
  - BSR's web quota has been increased.
  - Devin is working on staff training documents.
  - Earlier this week, the name of our server was sent to a spam
    blocking list.  This problem has not yet been fixed.  The most
    straight forward solution would requires us to use SMTP-auth, and buy
    a cert (~$100-$250).  David mentioned that we may be able to get a
    cert through campus for free.
  - Devin would like to buy a new webcam (<= $200) for the lab.  This
    could be helpful in monitoring the status of the lab.  David
    mentioned that we might want to invest in a robotic mount.
  - Consider disabling the "The future of the OCF is uncertain."
    message, and replacing it with a request for used hardware donations
    (explained in next item).
  - Devin would like to set up a program to give computers to student
    groups that lack sufficient resources.  This would require people
    to donate their used to computers.  So if you have any old
    computers (preferably >= 500Mhz), or know someone who does, and
    were planning on parting with the machine, please consider
    donating it to the OCF.
  - Staff members intersting in getting advanced training should
    contact Devin.
  - Capable staff members are encouraged to volunteer to train new
    staff.



Meeting

  - ASUC International requested use of the lab on October 17, and
    October 24, from 6-9pm.  They do not require exclusive use of the
    lab, but would like 10-15 machines for accessing the internet.
    No objections were made.
  - HKN is planning a Career Fair for February.  If people are
    interested, it might be a good oppurtunity for fundraising by
    helping to organize it.
  - We will be enrolling in a fundraising program called eScrip
    (http://www.escrip.com).  The general idea is as follows
       1. Customer goes to excrip site, and registers with the
          program, agreeing to donate a percentage of their spendings
          to the OCF
       2. Whenever a registered customer spends money at stores
          involved in this program (Safeway, OfficMax, ...) a
          percentage of the money spent will be donated to the OCF.
  - Excess and Salvage has been called to bring a large bin in order
    to deal with cleaning out the Barrows room.
  - Excess and Salvage is looking for volunteers to help put together
    machines from the parts they salvage.  Warning, their office is
    near San Pablo and Ashby.
  - Jeremey would like to remind all staff that account names must be
    based on the user's real name.  Please pay close attention to
    account names during approval.  The command, pre-approve, checks
    for this automatically (though it might not be very accurate).
    Patrick reported that smcc has a script that compares a user's
    name to their chosen account name, but it was not found at
    the location given: ~smcc/namecompare.  This is currently being
    resolved.
  - The wireless network, 4242..., will be going down Friday Oct. 17,
    and ASUC wireless will replace it.
  - Patrick spoke with Building Ops, an electrician is supposed to fix
    the AC issue next week.
  - We sold one of the Dell boxes for $600.
  - We sold the old AC unit for $1,000.
