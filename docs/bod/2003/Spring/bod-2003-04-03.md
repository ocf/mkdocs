jeffe:

brought crossoverOffice and installed on mao
and normal office

powerpoint, word, excel

simulateReboot (if it crashes)
also got this- haven't done it yet
epde=windows manager looks like xp


bem: 
could use kde-with xp scheme
it'll do something closer to what users expect

jeffe: we can try out both and see which one is better 

patrick:
budget-->new year: going to be due monday
had tom baker come up--there was a split counter (near firestorm)
patrick emptied it and someone will have to have it done

lululin: will talk to ppl we are hosting about possible solutions about this

aoshi:
dwc had nothing to bring up: other than katt's thing (survey)

internal server error (talk to katt about this)-->was sent to staff@ocf (?)
maybe it's just one person
patrick used it without problem
kevyeung: breaking mysql?
mao still has to be integrated into current nis+ setup
and have to check a few security things and then it will be up for open use
whether or not it gets use is another thing but...


tape drive
after talking to accounting
and the person talked to campus accounting (told him it was an iffy situation)
asuc aux: has attorney on retainer (forwarding him the information)
pay shipping (and send it back)
and not negotiation further (since it's not going to be such a good deal; like originally) since they already violated the order

please forward to me (Patrick-->)
I made a mailbox for this
also sent me an email saying that this was the last warning (before what?)


Purchases: budget due monday (next fiscal year)
I know ppl have finals etc but we've been talking about it at length
we'll have a little bit more money bc of the tape drive
blinds: talked to them over break
send the installation tech to do measurements since it had been 2.5 years
to refresh memory about exact specs.
coming back out monday/tuesday to install them
chairs; had one buried in the corner (that was done) : )


paying for printing: 
(not sure how much) 
Lavonia about it
make a form (pay her) and bring back a form: like a voucher
over 250> and you have to pay us

lululin:
can we make a profit off of this

patrick:
yes, we can do this
(we have to sign up as a profit organization)-->revenue
and then it doesn't have to disappear after it

Tomas Soratino
--------------
we own 18 computers
and we have peak 11 polls operating
we are currently running the election
we don't have all the computers to man all the ones at the same time
our plan: linksys routers (we only use for a few days we can lend these later if -->loan computers and man power?)

ballot.berkeley.edu
500 reward if anyone hacks the election
should put legal disclaimer about this

dans: don't open until you tech ppl --> you may use computers to do this

we can drop by blades later

but we can screw up windows machines easily


tomas: we can give you food and whatever title you want
we can handle pickup etc.: power strips and extension cords
there are going to be stored in the van
parking structure in lower sproul (or somewhere safer)

should look at manville

aoshi:


what are we doing with hte machines for the rest of hte year
something interesting can be done with them

hoping for 30 machines
we can possible get 15

campuslink ones?
they have to be on upper sproul

dans is going to help out

it may not hit all the polling locations
airbears is going to be tricky
they are technically and ours
we can test one

we can email dans and put shortcuts 

we can release one of the boxes for it
we are just testing the ports

------------------end this----------------------------------------

in agreement with bod: 15 sunblades
we can led monitors
somebody else is doing the labor
harddisks
we have spare scsi 

we're possibly having ppl that might want to be on staff
aoshi-->out
maybe be there later

there's a room on the secon form: to move our server 
fiber link
it would also be quicker if our servers were in escheman

as patrick says there's a server room or a lan room on the second floor of esclemon
which was the ocf server rom about fifteen years ago
since I've been here it's student government storage 
we've reclaimed the rm for student servers
some ppl have been crashing to gether (colocating)
and ocf has some problems with space allocation
and not that the frig/microwaves etc.
I was planning 2-3 racks for student servers
10-12' room
if we want to colocate than we can pay for the racks
(latter rack, vertical, etc.)
the rm is alarmed, locked, internal alarm (direct link to ucpd)
myself and tom baker only ppl with key, someone would be granted key and alarm code as well as entry code (24 7 hour)
student groups (will only have partial access for them)
if you guys are still looking to colocate- within-it'll be a gigabit
5 racks total (we could have 3)

it's been brought to my attention
(project with cns) point to point 
moving forward bc customer orientated (my ip will not be allowed outside)
fictitious ones out (set up nat box) 192 subnet won't be spammed out


only 192 will come through (e.g. != 128)

csua: getting kicked out
would want in as colocate if we pay some of the cost
we'd like more access if not then not necessary
24 hour access
we are asuc student group

lululin;
we can get someone that is both ocf and csua

csua!=xcf

sol: diversification is a good idea

some history of cooperation

...real minutes end here
<...the conversation kind of disintegrates at this point>
nat is a hidden cost

patrick: motion to adjoirn
lululin:second
