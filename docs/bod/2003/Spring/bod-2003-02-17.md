Patrick Hsu:
	What's going on with the book swap(swap, exchange thing)
	It's currently redirecting to a ".com" site (-->comegetused.com)
	Do we want to remove their virtual hosting

intc policy: (hotornot)
     It's a security issue right now
     their scripts suck and it's easy to find exploirs for them (dwc already mailed him about it)
     privacy and consent (lack thereof) policies
     pictures were moved to \deleted but they are still world readable (change?0

Randy: (aoshi)
       two options
       police (for him)-->bad
       do nothing
       as long as he deals with the issues as it comes than it's okay

fung/bem: have campus deal with it
we can't do much if it's in compliance
even if it's unhappy...etc.
if we work here--> we are all volunteers

lpr m (try this)
all staff should be able to do this

Problems:
We are currently having problems with tinted fonts.  Our printer isn't handling the files correctly and they get stuck in the queue, so that no one else can print.

Solution: upgrade (firmware)

We need to implement paid printing as well (make this a proj)

make Eric staff (already done by luns)

Figuring out budget for this:

Computer <David Fulmer>
	 there are ppl that complain about ocf (lack of services)
	 that want to colocate with him
	 this is okay (then the csba -->go away)
