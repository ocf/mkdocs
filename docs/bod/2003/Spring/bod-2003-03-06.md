GM Report:

jeffe: check to see who's on bod: everyone's still on bod

patrick: cns tech said there was nothing with the phone except with stuck button
but really something wrong with jack
$1800 for blinds: got the measurements for them (three years ago)


SM Report:

dwc:
was busy with class/homework
check with network upgrade: need more info though (type of fiber etc)

aoshi:
staff training moved to next week: will be posted when responses come back as to available times

Old Business:
-------------

imac (ilamp)
-------------
-bem: next week (when i get time)


hardware purchases
-------------------
-more ilamps?
-get the imac working first before deciding how to spend money
-newest 10.2 does support nis

-checkpoint: check with bem next week to see what's going on (but before end of the semester)

do we care about flatscreens? they do take up less space =)
we aren't separated from (falmer's) dhcp server
-1-2 printing-->2 sides-->count as 2 pages
-defaults:
	Unix-->both sided (easiest way--> single sided: insert blank ones between) 
	Windows-->single sided

-motion to keep it the same (patrick), second (ajani)--->voted (aye)


-broken chairs got taken downstairs (patrick would check on this)


New Business:
-------------

-tape drive
 had contact with sales rep
 did not include 10 backup tapes (price difference 500 dollars)
 looking at prices (not a very good deal) 
 after we pay them for the drive (even though the order was not filled): they'll send two more
 our purchase order lists by item: for tape drive and backup tapes (specifically listed)
 patrick will follow up on this
 we have email and PO that says what the ten tapes would be included (but the item number doesn't)
 akopps: no prices on website, had to ask, wasn't going to buy it for sure, but was told we would be given ten tapes with the drive. got the drive a month after we ordered but no tapes. been talking to the guy that replaced the original rep (that doesn't work there anymore) 
 -different deal because we're a student group
 -akopp will make sure that the tapes are sent already

 -patrick: says a little shady-->switch and bait (matter of principle): made purchase based on (ten tapes)
 -PO has part numbers no one can read (was told that it includes the ten tapes)
 -need to be explicit if we are sending it back that we are not paying the restocking fee
 -points in our favor: if the university frowns upon it, then they will be blacklisted--> 
  could become seriously though (all uc not just Berkeley)
  more info << next bod and pass it along

  Course of action: ignore the "where's our money": check has been made out
                    "refer to them gm," order never fulfilled (they have central acct's num)
                    going to get in touch with Central accounting (else draft email to take a lot)-
	          -->to see what legal action we can take
		if we're going to return it-->unless they pay for shipping, 
				         we'll just leave it there

dwc: supernova has had problems
-may be responsible-->windows users have had problems logging in
-been crashing about one a day
-have you patched lately? (akopp)--> only sendmail
-samba crashes and logfiles-->
		   samba broken, user mode, restart (shouldn't do this unless it's kernal mode)

-haven't talked to luns about this yet
-ajani: scsi device might be locking up: dwc-->should be seeing some other messages also
 but maybe they got erased
-might be responsible for users not being able to log in to windows (not windows responsible though)
 testing using samba (authenticating) to supernova: passwd works, something after passwd authentication
 maybe something to do with profiles->but haven't used before etc.
 -dwc is going to look into this
