who will be family heads?
  - asai
  - dkessler
  - keur / jkuki (ask first)
  - shichenh
  - bzh
  - wporr
  - bchieng (maybe -- ask first)
  - abizer (maybe)

every ocf meeting will be 20 minutes of [light] technical instruction followed by
family time.

families are now a means of social integration; not project-oriented.
better communication b/t families -- updates should be global. avoid cliques.

decal 8/9PM T/T. desktops prioritized for decal students.

bod is dismissed and we will now watch the town
