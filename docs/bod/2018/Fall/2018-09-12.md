  join the discourse channel if you care about staff stuff.

  We're nonprofit. Getting money is hard. Currently have funding by longterm STF grant 2 years ago.

    1. Renew STF
    2. Apply for CACCSF? 
    3. Referendum (increase tuition)

  Staff sponsor retiried five years ago. Have kept him around. Need new sponsor with charge string. Vote on options when present
