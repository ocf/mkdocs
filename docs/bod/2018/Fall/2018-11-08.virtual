Board of Directors Electronic Meeting

On November 7, 2018, asai announced his intention to resign from his
position as GM, and appointed the two DGMs at the time, awelty and
trliu, to take his position as acting GMs until their possible future
election to a permanent position. As BoD was not to be in session for
two weeks due to the Veteran's Day holiday, he called for an
electronic vote to have BoD confirm the appointments of the
aforementioned officers as acting GMs.

The following users were members of the Board at the time the
vote was called. 10 votes in favor were necessary for the resolution
to pass. The votes submitted and the times they were received are
