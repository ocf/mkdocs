*CLA:
Github term of services protect against revocation of code
Current contract is between OCF and staffer, but OCF is not a legal entity; thus the new contract would have to be between ASUC and staffer
Would have to talk to CLO about new CLA we are about to draft
Staffer owns their own contributions; just can't revoke
