G.M. Announcement:
-toner (griffin): coming tomorrow
-ASUC Elections (geo): good job guys, check's coming soon
-Party (tdhock): sweet party everyone

SM

Project Wrap:
-MCC events (jkit)
-Web poll (elliot)
-Staff profiles (jkit): jkit's been teaching Kang and Melissa how to
 make the new social network for OCF
-Logo (gordeon): it's ready, he's going to print it out
-T-shirts/Banner (tdhock)
-LDAP/Kerberos (yury): dilemma: we need to decide whether or not we
 want to do a reregister (the hacker may still have some account info,
 etc).  This would cause the problem of every single user having to 
 come into the ocf and reenter their password.  Plus, we may or may 
 not have enough manpower to reregister everyone.  Or maybe we could 
 just re-register staff.  Maybe we should administer two systems and 
 try to encourage people to switch over to the new system (possibly 
 through offering more web-space/printing pages if they do switch)
-Webserver (sle/dima): moving death onto famine, itself
-Windows image (sahnn): windows xp is coming in fall 2006
-Scanner docs (yury): nothing
