<h3>Introductions</h3>

<ul>
<li>Everyone introduced him/herself.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Announcements</h2>

<ul>
<li>David A Fullmer (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~remlluf/">remlluf</a>): Eshleman/MLK network is going down briefly on Monday, March 26.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>General Manager / Site Manager (GM/SM) Messages</h2>

<ul>
<li>No GM/SM messages in particular today.  General discussion
occurred.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Discussion Items</h2>

<h3>Toner</h3>

<ul>
<li>Griffin Foster (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~griffin/">griffin</a>): We still don't have toner.  NewEgg sent us bad toner, which we returned, and now we are waiting for the new toner to arrive.</li>
</ul>

<h3>SUN Party Review</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>OCF held a party today in appreciation of SUN Microsystems, and
their Chief Technology Officer in particular, John Fowler.
SUN and Mr. Fowler, in conjunction with EECS and Big Ideas
at Berkeley, arranged for the donation of a new SunFire v40z server to OCF.</p></li>
<li><p>Toby Hocking (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~tdhock/">tdhock</a>): SUN Party could have gone
better; we needed an organized publicity team.</p>

<ol>
<li>for getting OCF more visibility</li>
<li>for improving relations with (in this case) SUN and EECS</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Devin Jones (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~jones/">jones</a>): (On the other hand,) I think
companies do these events more for viral marketing; if a SUN executive gets
young people interested in SUN, then he's doing his job.  OCF only provides
basic IT services, so Fowler is probably not expecting anything really
innovative; just the fact that we're still using SUN hardware is a victory for
them.  </p>

<p>If computational physics people want to do something with SUN hardware with
30 processors, that would be great (but it's different).  </p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Cluster Computing?</h3>

<h4>Is there need or interest?</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Toby Hocking (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~tdhock/">tdhock</a>): People have computationally
intensive projects, but it seems like the problem is
already solved; departments have clusters.  Besides that,
it's a waste if there's no demand.  OCF is about
democratic computing, and clusters don't help a lot
of people.</p></li>
<li><p>(Are there people outside of departments that need
clusters?)</p></li>
<li><p>Jimmy Kittiyachavalit (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~jkit/">jkit</a>): Using department clusters
requires local insider knowledge and permission.  If we offered similar 
services, it might encourage people to use a cluster.</p>

<ul>
<li>Toby Hocking (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~tdhock/">tdhock</a>): We could offer a class on
cluster computing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Devin Jones (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~jones/">jones</a>): All you need is a few people and
a few hypothetical examples of uses.  If people are
interested besides me, we should just do it and then see
what happens.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Feasibility</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>See also related topics in this week's minutes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Funding section</li>
<li>Mission section</li>
<li>Productivity section</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>SUN seems to moving in the direction of clusters.</p></li>
<li>Devin Jones (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~jones/">jones</a>) can help set up clusters.  It is a good experience.</li>
<li>It takes a few days of full time work for one person to
set up a cluster (example was for a 100 machine cluster).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mission of OCF</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>(Following upon cluster computing...)</p></li>
<li><p>Yury Arkady Sobolev (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~yury/">yury</a>): This goes back to "what is the
mission of OCF?"  W&amp;MF is superior for general computing.</p></li>
<li><p>Devin Jones (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~jones/">jones</a>): There's a really good statement
in the constitution, basically that "OCF is about
gathering resources and giving them away to people." Back in
the day you basically had to be a CS student just to get
e-mail.  OCF was created just to give everyday people access
to computers.</p>

<p>My personal feeling is that (today) OCF could
offer more cool web services, Webspace is still the killer
app.  It's a good general thing.  Personally I'd like to
make it more web friendly, so people don't have to learn
the command line.  It would also be cool to gather more
cutting edge services, like cluster computing.</p>

<p>The cool thing is that over time OCF has trained legions
of really good IT people.  Literally dozens of people have
come out of OCF with really solid skills, and in the process
(of that training) everybody else benefits (from utilizing
the services).</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Funding and Donations</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>(Related to cluster computing options...)</p></li>
<li><p>Do we have a problem with funding?</p></li>
<li><p>Devin Jones (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~jones/">jones</a>): (Funding) doesn't have to be a
problem if we get donations. What are people interested
in?  Our past (serious) attempts have been successful.
Don't be afraid to ask.</p></li>
<li><p>(Have we even been <em>trying</em> to get donations?)</p></li>
<li><p>David A Fullmer (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~remlluf/">remlluf</a>): Or you can go in front of the
and ask for a budget increase, as long as you can justify it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Devin Jones (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~jones/">jones</a>): All basic necessities (e.g.
backups) should be covered by ASUC.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Derek Chan (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~dwc/">dwc</a>): We should try to have a demand
for services or hardware before we start asking people
for more resources.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Organization and Productivity</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Do we have enough people-power?  Are people lazy?</p></li>
<li><p>Devin Jones (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~jones/">jones</a>): Watching this organization over many years, OCF is
not actually short on manpower.  It's just whether people are motivated.  It's
more of whether the OCF provides something that seems more fun that
(schoolwork).  graduating.  If people generate new projects, new hardware,
people will either jump or it, or they won't, depending upon a lot of factors.  </p></li>
<li><p>Some (many?) users would like to get involved but can't figure out how to.</p></li>
<li><p>Yury Arkady Sobolev (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~yury/">yury</a>): We shouldn't overreach; last year
we advertised improvements we didn't actually give (e.g.
disk quota increase).</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Team Updates</h2>

<h3>Web Team Update</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Web Team meeting attendance has been sporadic this week.</p></li>
<li><p>Staff Hours/Staff Profile:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remaking staff hours/staff profiles page.  Basic PHP is done.
Two web team staffers said they were going to add onto it.  </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Event Scheduler:</p>

<ul>
<li>No new work this week.</li>
<li>Jimmy Kittiyachavalit (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~jkit/">jkit</a>) plans to work on it over spring break.</li>
<li>What is the scheduler?
<ul>
<li>Joint venture with MCC; they don't have a calendar
scheduler.  Nobody knows their scheduling except them, and only
because they have e-mail.</li>
<li>Based on PHPiCal, with add functionality, e.g.:
<ul>
<li>Apply for times/spaces</li>
<li>Administrators can log in and approve applications.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Only thing not done currently is authentication.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Toby Hocking (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~tdhock/">tdhock</a>): Good job on SUN recognition paragraph on our main website.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>LDAP/Kerberos Team Update</h3>

<ul>
<li>Yury Arkady Sobolev (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~yury/">yury</a>):  Steven Yuifai Luo (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~sluo/">sluo</a>) and I both had midterms.
We are short on human resources.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Publicity/Flyering/Tabling Team Update</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Catherine Lynn Davidson (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~cld/">cld</a>) tried to figure out how to get t-shirts made.  We need a logo.</p></li>
<li><p>David A Fullmer (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~remlluf/">remlluf</a>) suggests:</p>

<ul>
<li>Picture of someone fishing into a window-shaped pond</li>
<li>Fishing with CAT 5 (ethernet) cable</li>
<li>Fishing for/hooking credit cards</li>
<li>Caption: "Gone phishing?"</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Catherine Lynn Davidson (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~cld/">cld</a>) suggets some sort of play on "The OC."</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Server Team Update</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Dmitriy Shirchenko (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~dima/">dima</a>) and Stephen Le (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~sle/">sle</a>) stayed up all night to set
up the v40z.  Still need to install/migrate Apache, Perl/PHP, MySQL.  MySQL
can possibly stay on <em>death</em>, though mysql might overload death if/when we
move mail onto <em>death</em> as well.</p></li>
<li><p>We don't know if we can finish the migration by the end of the semester.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Windows Imaging Team</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>No one from the Windows imaging team was present.</p></li>
<li><p>Useful information:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Setting Firefox's global default cache size is now on
the <a href="http://docs.ocf.berkeley.edu/staffwiki/Mozilla_Firefox">Staffwiki</a></p></li>
<li><p>Quota profile size is encoded into group policy.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Eshleman Team</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>BoD voted to put our systems back in the Eshleman lounge.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We had four, Jimmy Kittiyachavalit (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~jkit/">jkit</a>) is using one, now we have three.</p></li>
<li><p>The systems are still in the server room.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>This team does not exist, though we need it.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Byung Kyu Park (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~novakyu/">novakyu</a>) is apparently assigned to the job,
but does not appear to have been making progress on it.</p></li>
<li><p>Yury Arkady Sobolev (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~yury/">yury</a>): He has midterms.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>David A Fullmer (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~remlluf/">remlluf</a>): In the past, lounge officials only wanted
web browsing enabled on the systems.  Now they can be fully functional, with
office, etc..</p></li>
<li><p>Network access</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There is network access in Eshleman, just not to the 7th floor lounge itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Is VPN through AirBEARS an option?</p></li>
<li><p>(In reponse to Dmitriy Shirchenko (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~dima/">dima</a>)'s point-to-point networking
proposal:)</p>

<ul>
<li>David A Fullmer (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~remlluf/">remlluf</a>): Any exposed external devices mounted on
buildings must be passed through the campus aesthetics commitee. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>More Discussion</h2>

<h3>Game Server?</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Jimmy Kittiyachavalit (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~jkit/">jkit</a>): SUN is working on gaming, backing
Sony, etc..  [Mr. Fowler] said "we should give you a game
server."  If we're interested, we should contact him.</p></li>
<li><p>(People generally thought that) Fowler seemed able
and willing to give rather liberally (relative to OCF's needs).</p></li>
<li><p>We have minimal support for a game server team, e.g.
Calvin Ardi (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~cardi/">cardi</a>), George Wu (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~geo/">geo</a>), Elliot Block (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~elliot/">elliot</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>David A Fullmer (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~remlluf/">remlluf</a>): The current ASUC president is behind a game
cluster project, as are the gellateria people.  This kind of proposal can't
come from my office, but let me know if you want to do it.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Library Proxy</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>The library proxy does not appear to be working anymore.</p></li>
<li><p>David A Fullmer (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~remlluf/">remlluf</a>): E-mail the library and tell them we
have qualified administrators on (specified) IP range.</p></li>
<li><p>Toby Hocking (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~tdhock/">tdhock</a>): Ideally we want everyone to be
able to use the library sites with zero configuration on the
part of the user.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Constitutional Review</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>The constitution covers procedure, rather than technical policies.
Everyone on BoD should ideally be familiar with the constitution. </p></li>
<li><p>Constitution and policies are not always updated; we may have
to go through all the minutes to make sure that our formal
documents are revised to the current date. One can do this
in chunks (rather than all at once) as long as one documents
that "constitution is current up to date <em>X</em>."</p></li>
<li><p>Catherine Lynn Davidson (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~cld/">cld</a>) informally volunteers to examine constitution and
policies.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>More Leadership/Organizational Positions?</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Toby Hocking (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~tdhock/">tdhock</a>) proposes creation of additional management
positions, especially a publicity manager.</p></li>
<li><p>Jimmy Kittiyachavalit (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~jkit/">jkit</a>): Titles are nice, but what would they do?</p></li>
<li><p>Derek Chan (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~dwc/">dwc</a>): You can make more positions, but don't make them
constitutionally required.  These positions can be "delegated by (GM/SM)."</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>ASUC Elections</h3>

<h4>Logistics</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>April 25, 26, 27 (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday) </p></li>
<li><p>Duties:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Set up 16 locations on campus (connect routers and laptops)</p></li>
<li><p>On call at ASUC headquarters</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>Why participate?</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Individual Incentives</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Hang out with OCF staff, LAN, eat</p></li>
<li><p>Can put it on your resume</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Service and Professionalism</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Good way to help the campus community.</p></li>
<li><p>Devin Jones (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~jones/">jones</a>): The cool thing is seeing a project with a
really finite deadline get done, and get done well.  OCF has always
done a really good job.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Beneficial to OCF</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Good opportunity for publicity.</p></li>
<li><p>OCF tends to get donations (not guaranteed).</p></li>
<li><p>ASUC decides OCF's funding.  We make a good impression
when we show that we are helpful, responsible and skilled.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>OCF will participate.</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Toby Hocking (<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~tdhock/">tdhock</a>): "I give it my thumbs up."</p></li>
<li><p>General consensus that OCF will help run ASUC elections</p></li>
</ul>
