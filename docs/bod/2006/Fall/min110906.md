SM Message

- migrating disk array, send out message on ocf-announce soon
- LDAP/Kerberos testbed working, yury and sluo disagree on something about storing password hashes, yury: "meh"
- yury's classes getting in the way of his OCF duties, research indicates that no SM has ever graduated on time, ever
- something is going to be accomplished in a month
- we're going to buy a 6U UPS (fatty), mail in 2 old ones using prepaid boxes
- need to update staff-wiki
- IRC discussion
	motion by yury to give channel ops to current GMs and SMs, one-strike rule to be enforced by dwc, griffin seconds
		motion passes: Y:11  N:5  A:0
	sluo: yury and dwc don't like each other, predicts IRC nuclear holocaust
	lengthy discussion of trolling
- yury proposes a calnet authentication, approval system - no more need for physical forms
	Good: easy for users, reduces workload for staff, benefits are "severalfold" according to yury
	Bad: security, users don't know where the lab is, people forget signatures, lack of physical signature "a lot of places accept digital signates, "some technical difficulties"
	Also: this system would work in conjunction with the current approve system, not inteded to replace it

Meeting adjourns at 8:25 PM Pacific Standard Time
	brought to you by dima and frank
