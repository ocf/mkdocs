== Staff Hours ==

Dara - Staffers must hold one hour of staff hours per week, coming to BoD is also preferable.  Any issues?

*Back to staff hours*

== RT ==

Dara - To access go to rt.ocf.berkeley.edu  Email timothy if need access.

== Worknights ==

Dara - Worknight once a week on Sat/Sun (Sat night probably).  Come to ocf, work on a few things, can do some fun stuff afterwards.  Meant as get things done time, and also bonding time.  When works?

*After some deliberation Saturday is picked as temporary solution*

Dara - Bod should be less technically involved, offload technical stuff to work nights.  Avoid flame war in BoD.

Dara - Want to get whiteboard into ocf, more on that laterâ€¦

== FAQ ==

Dara - Working on FAQ to anticipate most user questions.
