Surge

Dara - Main concern is surge, new eshelman.  Determine where ocf is moving in next few months

Sanjay - When lab is 75% full, it becomes uncomfortable.  Members are within striking distance.  Need about 550 sq ft for 15 people, since also need to place pubs staffers, printers, toners, ocf staff.

Dara - Vast majority of members are students.  Fire code restrictions are an issue.  What happens if there are too many people; lounges are very useful.  Lounge area is important aspect of ocf, differentiates ocf from other computer labs.  Are ocf users allowed to use outside cubicles.  Need to deal with overflow situations.
