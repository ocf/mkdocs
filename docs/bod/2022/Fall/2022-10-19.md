### Computer Donations
- What are we doing with them?
- server test beds until we figure out what to actually do with them


### Berkeley Subdomain Moratorium

- Hostmaster is not going to give *.b.e. domains any more to RSOs (at present)
- Main arguments are accessibility and security
- Hostmaster says a "review of all RSO domains is coming soon :tm:" (unsure what the goal of this is?)
- This has happened in the past (2013)
    - daradib (alumni) gave a recap of this to officers@
    - The resolution last time was to add the disclaimer
- njha has emailed several people
    - Bill Allison (Berkeley CTO)
        - Response: not aware of this
    - Dr. Brian Harvey (Past Advisor?)
        - Response: who to email
    - Kellsie A. Adams-Briesch (Hostmaster)
    - James Weichert (ASUC AAVP)

- EDIT: sike
- Patrick Holmes says it's apparently a miscommunication w/ hostmaster
    - meeting this Friday


### Need-Based Stipends
-  [Proposal draft for need-based stipends](https://notes.ocf.berkeley.edu/4Gt8DAncQ0elE_GTpEBeBgÂµ)
    - tldr; people with demonstrated need can do ocf project (technical) and be paid
    - **vote here!** https://forms.gle/SGNyrpbmamdE5EnL9
        - will discuss results next week
    - punt for this meeting since main people are not present
- work-study for opstaff?

### AAVP Meeting Recap
- Recommends not going for campus funding methods like CASSA/CACSSF (previously recommended by Henry)
- Instead, look for changing ASUC bylaws
    - Allow ABSA to be spent on opstaff stipends
    - Or even create a write in for bylaws to provide funding (including opstaff) (no need to apply for ABSA every year)
- Next steps:
    - Meet with ASUC finance committee
    - Work with ASUC legal office?
    - Talk with alumns about our relationship with ASUC / what balance we want to have
- previously:
    - funding from Student Tech Fee
    - before, no opstaff (B&G covered front desk)

### ASUC Legal Office "Interview" recap
- Legal Office starting to crack down on some ASUC bylaws
- Chartered Program Mascots must have ASUC logo?
- Chartered Program Websites must be hosted on ASUC domain/subdomain?
    - we are working on this

### Buy Sheet
- ocf.io/buysheet
    - Mac Mini: GPU drivers work already! This is surprising!
        - They are also cheapish ($699 pre edu-discount, and there are volume discounts for edu from apple)
        - Also low power (ðŸŒ² green ocf)
        - Also more power than the OCF needs
        - Proposal: Buy ONE for now as a testbed, to see if it's viable. If it is, buy lots more and do a full desktop refresh. (finally)
- Add more items to buy this semester: ocf.io/buy
