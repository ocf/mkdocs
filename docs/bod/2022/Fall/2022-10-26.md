### Berkeley Subdomain Moratorium
- njha wrote proposal, go read it
    - if we like it, he will email it in
    - https://notes.ocf.berkeley.edu/BKqKYCnpQnilhUBcAkSLgA
    - met with Berkeley IT w/ etw, said if we come up with a proposal and they are happy with it we good
    - brand image issues - we should be clear that the sites are not official university content
    - they don't really care about accessibility
    - TL;DR All pages on a student groups’ website must prominently (at or near the top of the page) contain the phrase “student group”, “student organization”, “student-run” or something else to this effect
    - also we will not allow groups to request domains that may be confused for official services etc, such as `datascience`
    - also talked about ocf cooperation w/ the university on web related things, moderation-related things? since we don't have the bw to police content at all

### OCF + Teleport
- see officers@
- we are switching infra to Teleport
    - https://goteleport.com
- njha: want coreos on servers, nixos? on desktops
- we need to centralize authentication etc.
- need license for pluggable authentication
- got license from them

### Need-Based Stipends
-  [Proposal draft for need-based stipends](https://notes.ocf.berkeley.edu/4Gt8DAncQ0elE_GTpEBeBgµ)
    - tldr; people with demonstrated need can do ocf project (technical) and be paid
    - **vote here!** https://forms.gle/SGNyrpbmamdE5EnL9
        - will discuss results next week
    - punt for this meeting since main people are not present
- work-study for opstaff?
    - some major concerns from opstaff
        - max of hours worked per week (prevents opstaff from working as much as they want/subshifts)
        - not as much control of where the money made is going
        - limit on how much you can get paid
        - allows for more access for people to know about the job but this could impact quality? (someone who actually uses the ocf regularly vs someone who found out through work-study portal)
        - ocf can't grant work-study so it will be granted under ASUC Finance

### Mickael Advisor Meeting Recap
- Recommends going for campus funding methods (CACSSF)
- ASUC funding can't provide long term funding
    - Because ASUC budget is only provided/determined year to year
- Work study might be possible, but not a priority
    - actually get funding first
    - rameesha: logistical issues with work study (hour limit, subshifts, overall flexibility -- see above section)
    - work-study is all or none (?)
- Recommends working on CACSSF soon
- Historical context for funding: OCF half funded by university, half by ASUC. we intend to continue this in the future
- Deadline: ?? November? December?

### ASUC Legal Office Interview followup
- Legal Office starting to crack down on some ASUC bylaws
- Chartered Program Mascots must have ASUC logo?
    - we're working on it
- Chartered Program Websites must be hosted on ASUC domain/subdomain?
    - we already do this, so there is no concern here
