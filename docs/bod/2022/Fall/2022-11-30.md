    - ncograin
        - ocfer since fa21
        - found niche in external (former external head, have been currently resolving many RT tickets)
        - feel strongly about the subdomain transition
            - worth fighting, willing to put in effort to aggressively go after collecting input and opposing this change
        - ocf needs long term funding source
            - committed to working with ficomm to make this a reality
        - Q&A:
            - trinityc: what sources for long term funding are you looking at?
                - not too familiar with it yet, but want to work on this more
            - commitments?
                - less than this semester
                - reduced courseload, member of another club
    - jaysag
        - joined ocf this semester (fa22), first org
        - think ocf is great, and really like linux + the fact that it's open
        - priorities:
            - fight for subdomains and continue to keep up pressure as long as it's worth it for the rest of bod
            - secure funding via CACSSF and look into other solutions
        - could excel in administrative side and love writing emails as an english major
        - Q&A:

                - peer review board
            - luke: thoughts on systemd?
                - horrible (applause)
                - gentoo and wayland with sway
            - bencuan: other ideas besides the 2 noted?
                - wordpress, support SM's. will mostly focus on the 2 main topics
    - kian:
        - current internalcomm head, webgroup head
        - ocfer since fa21
        - want to continue working administratively, reclaim berkeley.edu subdomains for student groups
        - student outreach/retention: make ocf more approachable and easier to contribute to for new staff (has experience as internalcomm head)
        - make infrastructure more user-friendly and up to date
        - make projects more structured, and make them a good entry into the ocf (focus more on individual contributions)

        - brainstorm ways to make things more approachable 
        - Q&A:
            - njha: commitments?
                - breadths
            - trinityc: re making things more approachable: thoughts on long term staff retention vs attracting resume builders- how much should we structure, and how much newstaff should we expect?
                - mostly focus on attracting new staff who are already passionate about open source + linux, but don't know how to contribute. structure = better planning for projects, be conscious of the various paths newstaff can take to join ocf (cater to less experience people)
            - bryli: re better on boarding experience: main issue is there's no timeline or plan right now- what would you propose?
                - no specific timeline at the moment, but start planning for a guided experience into the ocf as soon as possible
            - yehchanyoo: as a new staff, lack of structure is an issue for participating but good to not have consulting club vibes- thoughts on structural implementation?
                - encourage staff to have some urgency to meet deadlines, but not as anything super official. get more feedback on individuals in the same situation
    - njha
        - former SM, current GM
        - working on k8s for the entire time
        - want to finish k8s
        - will be involved with ocf until graduating berkeley
        - want to make sure newstaff can take over and get involved to the point where they can become sm and be good at it

            - adarshiyer: what is k8s?
                - see professor njha's lecture slides

            - what is 9+10?
                - idk
                - what group?
