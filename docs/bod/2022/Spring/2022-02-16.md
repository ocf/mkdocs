 - Ask about their interests (based on groups/committees)
 - Ask for project ideas/things they want to see in the ocf
 - Hand out stickers
 - If you're comfortable doing so, share contact info (friend them on discord, etc)
 - Give them newstaff role on discord
 - Give them action items (ask for availability for meetings, contact SM's for more info about infra, etc.)

### Campus IT Printing Interrogation
- Friday 10 AM
- I think that cost, usage stats, student sentiment (that's a tougher one), management requirements/overhead, historical context and future plans are all applicable. Where did 20 pages/ day and 200/semester come from? Does OCF have a partnership with the libraries or other parts of the school on this? 
- Student Affairs IT have the following concerns (in order):

    student experience and needs
    admin workload
    $ (#finance-comm)
    number of pages
        - asai: lowered from 20->10 due to increased print demand, but raised it back when it got better. very few people print >20, but there are a few who try printing textbooks and use all our supplies

 - etw: rt#10932: graduate division printing query (never responded ?)
    
- Berkeley might implement a centralized student printing???
    - What does the Open Print Facility do in that case?

### After Hours Access
- Want general keycard (+server room) access after 10PM for all staff
- Conversation last semester was "there is a staffing shortage, no keycard 4 u" - sharay (@snarain, @ncbeberi)
- Revisit convo since
    - COVID rules being rolled back starting March
    - Full in-person instruction has resumed
    - Multiple stakeholders not just us: (SUPERB, B&G) nextdoor, and dance groups for Eshleman after hours
    - Talk to Kaitlyn (replacement for Bahar)?
- Issues last time:
    - Refrigerator
        - Fridge 4 keycard good trade IMO - asai
    - They said no one can sweep the building
        - B4 COVID the only sweep that happened was a building/UCPD officer came at midnight to check IDs. That's no different I think than the 10PM sweep we have now (in terms of staffing availability)
- Plan
    - Contact a Senator to advocate for us and gather stakeholders
        - Used to be Liam Will. Could ask for whoever's office succeeded his to help.
        - Building is co-owned with ASUC
    - Meet Eleanor about future building hour expansions

### Buy Sheet

        - 30 monitors to replace
        - rjz: purchased 2 ASUS PA278CV for 849 total for e.g. madcow
        - basically the best 1440p monitor for office use that doesn't really break the bank
        - Dell is solid, it doesn't have DP and 750Tis don't have HDMI 2.0 so only 30Hz on 4K
        - Also should we get a ultrawide for eruption and use the current monitors for desktops? ~$990 for Samsung G9 49"
        - bought a used colorimeter for $90
        - Spectrum monitor (good, but 1440p hard to get- basically vaporware at this point)
        - Needs DisplayPort and USB-C ideally
    - stickers
        - poll: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/12iCbHNP7N8m3TnitWHKRHJ9gql5QiZskLanxamulXi4/edit

    - custom mousepads
        - Is anyone working on making/compiling design suggestions?
