## Agenda

### Upcoming senate presentation
 - Needs to be scheduled (anyone know how to do this??)
 - Interested in presenting:
     - bencuan
     - ronitnath
     - rjz (slides)
     - etw
     - your name here?
 - Will hopefully take place in a couple weeks (after ASUC elections)
 - Main topics: spread awareness of OCF services, pass resolution of ASUC
   support to fund the OCF

### HPC Updates
 - GPUs shipped (from China), unknown arrival date but should be before end of
   semester
     - coming week ??? (fedex express shipping) (currently in the bay area
       container ship parking lot)
 - Do we need to buy any hardware in the meantime?
     - GPU server, single or dual Epyc 32C, 9K~12K w/o disks
     - current HPC server is quite underpowered, we need to upgrade
     - storage is scuffed - HDD-backed and over network (iSCSI)
         - it's actually a bottleneck right now
     - it's (probably?) possible to put new GPUs in old server
 - Potential staff projects: make hpc staff training / docs, decal lab for hpc,
   jupyterhub??

### OCF merch
 - Rachel's mousepad designs https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10dpOeBKo4ISnPZpQRMmBCIQwJr8acfyW?usp=sharing
 - Isabelle's tshirt designs https://slack-files.com/T02EV1K1G-F039UGM9P6E-4ad6bc314c https://slack-files.com/T02EV1K1G-F039MSXRK0W-48ee8101fc

we should start finalizing designs and coordinating these purchases, end of
semester is rapidly approaching


### Buy Sheet
- ocf.io/buysheet
- Additional info about social media boosting:
    - From Rameesha: "So across all the socials (FB, Twitter, Instagram), you
      can create a personalized audience to reach based on different factors
      but I think the most effective filter would be by location and in this
      case I would set it to the city of Berkeley (~ 25 mi radius). For content
      that would be boosted, I was thinking of only boosting posts promoting
      the OCF/services, not content like meet the staff. In terms of the actual
      money going towards the ad content, it varies by app but generally you
      can set a number of days you want to boost a post and have a set amount
      per day like $5 a day for 5 days would be $25. For Instagram they did
      give $10 credit randomly and i used that to boost a post and it ended up
      being really successful! We reached over 1.6K people and 73% of that was
      from the ad and i think we got 4 additional followers from it too!"
    - Current experimental allocation would be $100

bod thoughts:
 - pros:
     - good initiative, gives us more data
     - it's only $100
     - rameesha has put a lot of thought into this
 - cons:
     - advertising is good, but we can get free advertising via ASUC
     - we don't want to give fb more money
     - uncertain benefit

future action items:
 - reach out to ASUC
 - reach out to official Berkeley social media / building advertising to get
   OCF spotlighted
 - further exploration of advertising OCF services with the university

### Opstaff Updates
- OCF merch (Isabelle)
    - Looked into local screenprinter (The Grease Diner:
      https://www.thegreasediner.com/) and emailed them about pricing (how much
      for ~30 shirts?)
    - Interested in making OCF keychains (50 1.5in keychains for $95)

### Finance Comm
- Jenny is still ghosting us on our STF questions, so we still don't know /
  have any guarantees that our STF funds will continue to roll over
    - If STF funds don't roll over for next year, then we're screwed for
      funding next year. We should maybe tell James or Henry or someone else in
      the ASUC about this uncertainty

### Decal Comm
- DO responded saying that they'll resolve the issue by Friday.
- Remove sponsorship label if things don't work out / until things are fixed?
