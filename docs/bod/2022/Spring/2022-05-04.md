Finance

- Use leftover STF funds to pay opstaff for the next semester or two
    - Hopefully they roll over for next year (they may not continue to roll over at some point). Jenny McNulty (STF analyst) has completely ghosted us and there is no other authority on this
        - If the funds don't roll over, talk to James Weichert since he said the ASUC should have emergency funding for us if necessary
- Several options to explore for securing future opstaff funding:
    - Apply to CACSSF
        - Henry Isselbacher (ASUC CFO) said this is one of our best options since they actually have enough money to give us for long-term/repeated applications for funding
    - Get OCF in IREF
        - Jason Dones and James Weichert (ASUC people) said they are advocating for us on this
        - (Context: IREF is the (much more expensive) STF replacement being made by campus administrators as a campus fee; since it's a campus fee, there's no vote on it)
    - STF 3.0 (meme option)
        - James Weichert hinted that he may actually try this
    - Make and pass an OCF fee referendum
        - same process as passing STF, but to cover OCF costs only
    - If these options don't work, apply to CASSA and/or talk to James Weichert
- Printing and most hardware costs should still be able to be paid by ABSA (will still need to apply as usual every spring)

Decal
 - DO ghosting us
 - yeah
 - NP students
