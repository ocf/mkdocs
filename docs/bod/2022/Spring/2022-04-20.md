### Speech Notes (GM Elections)
jyxzhang
 - current gm, commcomm head
 - some stuff this semester that happened: trying to expand building access, stf tabled, ocf funding issues
 - but now he's very qualified to tackle these issues due to having cOnNeCtIoNs with our advisors and already actively working on it
 - adarshiyer: increasing use of FOSS?
     - more related for sm's
     - communicate with interested staff members (literally adarsh)
 - bryli: experiences/hardships with communication this semester?
     - asuc not being clear about stf being tabled, ocf was not consulted or notified
     - we need to keep in contact with asuc so we don't get blindsided again
 - anddone: next semester commitments?
     - similar to this semester, maybe lighter
 - adarshiyer: thoughts about co-gm's?
     - both very capable, kian has been running internal and njha knows the ocf very well both technically and administratively

njha
 - running for gm and sm
 - has been contributing more to the ocf administratively this semester
 - organized the largest purchase ever by a ucb rso!!
 - want to help manage more directly
 - todo/goals as gm:
     - expand ip address space
     - get stable source of funding for ocf
     - more snacks
     - get corporate funding/connections
     - want to lead bod because that sounds fun (it is)
 - adarshiyer: foss???
     - pro-foss candidate right here
 - bryli: if gm, how much will you contribute technically?
     - will probably keep working on new k8s, but will not work on web (sm plan)
 - anddone: any preestablished plans for contacting companies?
     - have been looking on and off, and successfully reaching out to companies (good track record so far)
 - etw: sm vs gm?
     - would prefer gm
     - can contribute technically either way
     - want to try something different
 - adarshiyer: vim or emacs
     - vim (instant answer)
 - rjz: commitments next semester?
     - way less (currently doing 20 units + part time job)
 - bryli: how will experience as sm apply?
     - a lot of gm's aren't too involved technically, having sm experience could help with policy decisions being in line with technical decisions (not that this has been a problem)
 - rmxu: any plans on funding now or sort it out later after you are elected
    - apply for CASSA (short term)
    - idk for long term, but no one knows
 - bryli: anything that should have more attention drawn to it?
     - getting non-asuc external support (aka companies)

kian
 - current internalcomm head
 - continue quest for after hours access - vital for socializing & making connections
 - funding issues post-stf, need to find more income (sponsorships, new stf, ocf fee) basically not being too reliant on asuc
     - save the daily cal initiative was successful, we should have a good chance of passing our own (especially if we ask for support from rso's and users)
     - table, spread the word, reach out to other orgs for shared ballot measures
 - continue promoting ocf as a place beyond printing- get stuf done, learn more about linux+tech, basically better than depths of soda
 - adarshiyer: same question
     - yet another pro-foss candidate, who could have guessed
     - if it'll affect general population of ocf users, we need to make sure it'll be accessible while still supporting open source
 - anddone: plans for making sure internal stays alive (also web)?
     - ensure we have strong recruiting foundation for fall
     - retention
     - 6 new ppl on web team this semester yay! get them to become more invested and keep going with the rewrite (gatsby+react), it should keep growing on its own (completion date eta 2030)
 - njha: getting hours extended- any plans? anything we haven't tried already?
     - make sure it's brought to the attention of our advisors and building managers, make it clear this is something the ocf really wants
 - jyxzhang: commitments for next semester?
     - probably lighter, 12 units maybe?? and taking break from job

waddles
 - check out their campaign posters around the lab!
 - extremely good outreach, will soon have cardboard cutouts and full fledged propaganda campaign
 - very cute, cutest gm candidate
 - hasn't missed a single bod since 1989
 - Spent no money for food during social 
 - no academic commitments

     - k8s (etw+njha)
     - EOL this summer (rip debian 9)
 - sm's have a job and they know how to do it
 - regardless of the official position sm's will be doing stuff
 - njha: why should i vote for you
     - having an sm is better than not having an sm
 - adarshiyer: same question
     - FOSS is good but sometimes it just doesn't add up
     - elastic license!
 - anddone: kuberfridge when
     - k8s enabled smart fridge = new staff project
 - jyxzhang: any new fresh ideas?
     - new k8s new k8s new k8s

 - new k8s
 - ocf security... passwords
     - move to mit kerberos
 - new printing accounting system, in-house
 - keep existing services running
 - adarshiyer: same question
     - neutral, foss is good but sometimes there are practical needs for proprietary software
 - jyxzhang: what will you take from this semester as sm into next semester?
     - have a general picture / todo list of things we want to achieve; having a plan is better than having no plan
 - bencuan: what will this plan look like?
