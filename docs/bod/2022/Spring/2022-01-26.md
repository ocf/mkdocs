   - Integrated into staff meeting
   - Previously tried this, very hard to pull off
   - Intro to codebase? Solve some github issues?
   - Notes/minutes for meetings that were held
   - More focus on group work and less about solo projects/tutorials?

Design

 - Incorporate design work into regular operations
 - External -> more design efforts, internal too actually
