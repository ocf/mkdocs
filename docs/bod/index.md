title: Board of Directors Minutes
---

The OCF Board of Directors has open meetings from 8-9PM every Wednesday. BoD is
where we discuss and vote on administrative decisions. If you are interested in
gaining insight into the internal operations the OCF from an administrative
perspective, please come to BoD meetings! Meetings always are open to all.

We usually hold the first BoD of the semester in the first week of instruction, and General Meetings the following week, but you should check the [OCF Chat](../user-docs/contact/chat.md) to confirm.
