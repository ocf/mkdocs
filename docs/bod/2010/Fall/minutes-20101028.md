GM Agenda:
: Paper Quota Policy: Users don't know about PDF multiple pages per sheet problems

Sanjay: I usually do a 5/6th's reimbursements
Sherry: Ad-hoc policy: email paper@ocf
Sanjay: To preserve our printers, we've started limiting jobs to 30 pages max (note: not 30 sheets)
But, how do we deal with people who seem to have legitimately gone over quota?
Sherry: for people who say they think they were wrongly deducted, we should look at their history and decide what to do
Sanjay: well, the PDF issue is the main one, if it doesn't come out of the printer PyKota definitely doesn't deduct from quota
Sherry:
Official policy:
staff discretion to decide how much paper to add back pages
Sherry: finished with quota, want to pay for more pages
At one point we actually did this, but then we ran into bugs and stopped
Han: Seems like it would provide more convenience to users by allowing them to pay for more pages,
than it would inconvenience them by risking these bugs
Sanjay: but staff could be put in uncomfortable situations if someone
is like 'hey you gave that person pages but not me
Maybe we could do 500 page blocks so that only people who really want to print a lot would buy
The technical stuff is all ready, it was done at one point, we just have to print out some forms
Using plain money, rather than charging by 'pages', could work
Sherry: that's kind of a long term solution, what about a short term solution for this specific user?
if we say no to one we should say no to all
Sherry: set a poor man's threshold so that if they're in the middle of a job and it goes over quota,
PyKota will let it slide
Sanjay: I think the default is 5 pages, so I'll just enable that

SM Agenda:
Crisis Management
Sanjay: A lot of stuff has been going wrong, and we have a lot of root staff
so when stuff breaks, do you know what the first thing to do is?
Email staff!
I know emailing staff saying you broke something
next, we need honest ETAs
So when something technical is majorly wrong, email me, then sle, then dwc
We have to be honest to users
if stuff will be down for a couple users, we should tell people, like on the blog
the blog is at http://ocfblog.blogspot.com

By the way, why the OCF Website was down? We set up automatic updates, and
it kept replacing our config files, and we had 3 different staff members commenting
out things trying to see what was wrong

so when you're editing important config files, mark your territory clearly

Another great resource is IRC: irc.ocf.berkeley.edu

apocalypse is being phased out, will invalidate a lot of server RSA keys
a lot of users will freak out, since they use ocf.berkeley.edu to FTP and stuff
we'll prepare a wiki page to show users

Also, we'll be downsizing, shutting down unnecessary hardware, using fewer IPs

Sherry:
OCF Banquet:
a lot of student groups typically have an end-of-the-semester banquet
Sanjay: We've been to Great China for the past 5 OCF banquets, so we're definitely not going there again
Sherry: so what we're gonna do is list what you dislike and we won't go there:
Mexican
CrepeVine
Great China
Ichiban
Asian Ghetto
DFC

Suggestions of places we _should_ go to:
Cheeseboard
La Petit Camille
Rose Bistro
<strike>Taste of the Himalayas</strike>
Kirala
Sushi House (SF)
Zabu Zabu

Sanjay:
Online Approve:
We recently crossed some technical barrier that lets us do approve online
We would probably do some kind of CGI/PHP type of thing
People would fill out a form and print a receipt that has a verification hash on it
Pieces:
PHP -> Data -> approve -> Pubs Staff

Motion to Adjourn
Seconded
BoD Ends 8:12pm
