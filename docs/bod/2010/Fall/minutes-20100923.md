New Staff Proj Upd.:
How's it going, do you need anything from us?
andy: linux images
Kevin: OpenNMS
Sanjay: we'll talk after BoD
anthony: Sanjay said he'll give me something

Lower Sproul Dis.:
12-1pm: who can go?
Felix, Han
Sherry and Sanjay will compile a list of things to bring up

HP&OCF:
Sanjay: They've said there's no strings attached but of course since it's an
ongoing relationship there's a string
TJ: Ask Dell for a counter-offer

New Linux Comps:
simplyhd: It'll be either a Dell or HP, probably purchase order placed next week,
shipping 5-7 business days (probably gonna be from Dell)

Lab Security (Pubs):
Sherry: There've been theft issues, sorting out with the front desk
also give them paper in there desk so they can refill if necessary
Sanjay: traditionally we've given them the combo
also instruct them why not to take acct forms

SM Agenda:
Sanjay: I'll be grovelling for servers
a lot of labs on campus or disposing of SPARC servers, no reason not to take
them
hidden reason: simplyhd and I went to Robert
tomorrow is a really important meeting
in years Bears Initiative starts, Eshleman closes
we'll be moved
we'll need to consolidate stuff
we need a really nice server we can put multiple VMs on

Printing:
Sanjay: technically how does printing work?
print server
PyKota: Python Quota system
it's performance right now is really slow
even though the network is fast it takes forever to write to the SQLite db
I'm looking into MySQL
it's also slow because we do it over NFS
MySQL provides these features

Security:
1st: clean up networking, server room's a mess
next: our switches are not secure
anyone can plug in a windows machine and do anything
they can start printing, use our domain
we should be careful that if we're charging for pages we sort this out
The system we're planning on using is 802.11X
device that plugs in to a switch on each port that says only this device can
plug in
Other than that we've also done stupid things like disabled teh switch on
the port remotely
Something I haven't done is add info about servers (which are secure, which
are open) to wiki
IPSec: especially if we're using Radius and people are logging into our WiFi
Approve only works on one server
we're only allowing it on supernova right now
we want the script to run on supernova
but the user input done on the login server (hanwei volunteers)
Tripwire:
we get so many security updates over email they're kind of devalued
we need to read these some time
Han: Daily digest?
Sanjay: rather than sending to root or wheel, send to something that'll
record to a blog
Ahir: I'll write something like that

Motion to add asalgado
unanimous
