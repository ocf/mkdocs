Sanjay: Pykota fixed.  Finally.
All: Yay!

Sanjay: We're rebuilding over summer.  Who's going to be around? A lot of
people are graduating and stuff.  I've already talked to Wilson.  Karl, can you
be around?
Karl: Yeah, I can help with programming or whatever.

Sanjay: The whole tmtong thing has been resolved.  He took down the pages, so
that's taken care of.  
Mike: Still haven't heard back from the lawyer, so we're on our own in the
future.

Sanjay: Banquet next week.  Attendance is mandatory.

Mike: IST wants us to take over Eshleman.
All: Hell no.
Sanjay: If they want to hire an individual, that's cool, but we can't commit the
whole group to it.
