Our hard-working student volunteers (hereafter OCF staff) try to keep documentation plentiful and up-to-date, but it's always lagging behind.

We recommend starting off by reading the FAQ. If you experience difficulties that can't be answered here, feel free to [contact us](contact).

If you're feeling adventurous, why not take a look at the [technical documentation](../staff-docs) intended for staffers?
