## Where have OCF staffers gone after leaving the OCF?

Many OCF staffers have found the skills and experience they gained from being
OCF staff have been useful after leaving us. While we obviously can't claim
credit for everyone or being the sole source of experience for people, we'd
like to think everyone who has donated time to help us has gained something in
return, whether it be skills, experience, new friends, or just the satisfaction
of making a difference helping your fellow students.

Some of the places OCF staffers have gone on to work at:
