## Preamble

We, the computer using community of the Berkeley campus of the University of
California, provide by this Constitution an organization dedicated to the
pursuit of obtaining and managing open computing resources. The intent of this
organization is to provide an environment where no member of Berkeley's campus
community is denied the computer resources he or she seeks. This group's spirit
can be traced directly to the former Undergraduate Computing Facility, however
this organization's membership is much more widely open. It is also the intent
of this group to appeal to all members of the Berkeley campus community with
unsatisfied computing needs and to provide a place for those interested in
computing to fully explore that interest. It is the intention of this group
that no small number of people ever control the accessibility of any OCF
sponsored computing facility.
