title: Upcoming Student Technology Fund Renewal Vote
---

### The Student Technology Fund
The [Student Technology Fund (STF)](https://techfund.berkeley.edu/) equitably and transparently stewards use of student fees in support of technology initiatives that advance undergraduate, graduate, and professional school studentsâ€™ academic and co-curricular experiences at UC Berkeley.

STF provides funding for:
 - Free software for all students on campus, including Zoom Pro, Adobe CC, Microsoft Office etc.
 - Projects like the Student Technology Equity Program (STEP), the Student Tech Services Helpdesk, __the Open Computing Facility (OCF)__, and much more.

Without the STF, students would need to acquire licenses for much of the software they use on a daily basis, and STF-funded projects would need to seek alternate funding (or become defunct).

The Student Technology Fund was voted into place by students in 2014. Unfortunately in the 2021 ASUC elections, the STF failed to meet the required threshold to pass.

### STF's Renewal Efforts

Students are leading STF's renewal efforts through an independent non-University entity called the STF Referendum Renewal Group (RReG).  To date, there is no known opposition group to the STF's renewal.
