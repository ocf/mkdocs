The OCF computer lab consists of 29 workstations running NixOS. They are maintained by OCF volunteer staff who operate the servers, workstations, and networking gear that helps the lab run.

The computer lab contains 3 scanners, 3 standing desks, and a Blu-ray/DVD/CD reader/writer.

OCF computers include free and open-source software such as LibreOffice (similar to Microsoft Office), GIMP (similar to Adobe Photoshop), and more.

## Location

The OCF computer lab is located in 171 MLK Student Union. It can be accessed through the main MLK building or via the tunnel by the stairs between Upper and Lower Sproul.

You no longer need to present a valid CalID on entering the OCF. However, our staff may request that you present your ID at any given time. If you cannot do so, you may be asked to leave the lab.

## Need help from an OCF staffer?

OCF staff are student volunteers who are usually not present in the lab.

The front desk staff can help with basic troubleshooting, but for technical or organization-related questions, it would be better to either chat with an OCF volunteer staffer during staff hours or contact us via email.
