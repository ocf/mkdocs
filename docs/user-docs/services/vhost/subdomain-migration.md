[[!meta title="Subdomain migration FAQ"]]

All student organizations that currently have berkeley.edu subdomains (e.g. myclub.berkeley.edu) will have them transitioned to be under studentorg.berkeley.edu (e.g. myclub.studentorg.berkeley.edu) by the end of the 2023-24 academic year. There are different timelines and instructions depending on the type of website that you have, so please review the details for the option that best matches your group. We have additional instructions at the bottom for groups that have email addresses at their domain as well.

## WordPress sites
* Your club's website is now also accessible at myclub.studentorg.berkeley.edu in addition to your current myclub.berkeley.edu domain
* On March 1, 2024, we will be forcing a redirect from myclub.berkeley.edu to myclub.studentorg.berkeley.edu
  * This means that users trying to access any page on myclub.berkeley.edu will be redirected to that respective page at myclub.studentorg.berkeley.edu
* We will be automating the transition for WordPress sites, but we will ask that you review your site on March 1, 2024 and make sure that everything works correctly
* If you have forgotten your group's OCF username or password, any signatory can visit https://ocf.io/password and view the username or reset the password
* You can access your site's WordPress admin dashboard at https://myclub.berkeley.edu/wp-admin
  * After March 1, 2024 you will be able to access your site's WordPress admin dashboard at https://myclub.studentorg.berkeley.edu/wp-admin instead
  * If you have forgotten your group's WordPress admin credentials, we have instructions on how to reset your password at https://ocf.io/wordpress#h3_i-forgot-my-admin-password-and-cant-log-in
