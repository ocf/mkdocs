# Hosting Badges

These logos are for organizations that have requested [virtual hosting](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/docs/services/vhost/) with the OCF, or for anyone else that wants to use them. You can either use the images hosted on our site, or you can download them and place them under your own. You're welcome to design your own too, but please [contact us](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/docs/contact/) first.
