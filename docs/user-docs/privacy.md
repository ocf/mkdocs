The Open Computing Facility (OCF) is committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information subject to various provisions of state and federal law.

We do not re-distribute or sell personal information collected from our web servers.

## Types of personal information we collect

- Information you provided during the signup process including your name, CalNet UID, and email.
- Messages you send on chat platforms that we manage.
- Communications such as email that you send to us directly.
- Outbound and inbound internet traffic on our servers, including source and destination IP addresses, pages accessed, username (if relevant), and access time.
- Logs collected during use of shell-based services such as our login servers and HPC.
- Data related to print jobs including the file itself.
- Metadata about virtually hosted mail sent through our servers including time, recipient, and sender.
- Cookies on our website in order to store login sessions.


Some highly sensitive data that we collect such as traffic logs is motivated by past events and security issues reported to us by the university. Again, we reassure you that this data is only used as described in this privacy policy.

Note: our web hosting service (https://ocf.io/web) allows user-run websites which may collect their own data and/or be governed by a separate privacy policy.

## How we use your information

We use information you have provided in order to maintain a robust and reliable set of services. In order to do that, we may use your information to:

- Respond to your inquiries or comments.
- Reach out to you regarding operational changes or issues that may impact your usage of our services.
- Troubleshoot and debug issues on our servers.
- Investigate and fix potential security issues or breaches, including ones the university reports to us.

We do not disclose, without your consent, your personal information except when required by law. We do not distribute or sell your personal information to third party organizations. We do not use external analytics platforms such as Google Analytics on our website.

## How we secure your information

Your data is secured via electronic safeguards that only allow access by our volunteer staffers who keep the site running. Additionally, highly sensitive logs such as internet and mail traffic logs are only accessible to a core set of root staffers.

## Revisions

We may make changes to this privacy policy at any time, and a notice will be posted visibly on the home page (https://ocf.berkeley.edu) for a period of time after.
