The Open Computing Facility (OCF) is an all-volunteer student organization dedicated to free computing for all University of California, Berkeley students, faculty, and staff.

We're passionate about open source and free software.

---

OCF volunteers maintain services for the Berkeley community, including:

- A spiffy computer lab in 171 MLK Student Union
- Web & email hosting for thousands of student groups and individuals
- Free printing for all UC Berkeley students
- Shell accounts on our powerful on-campus servers
- High-performance computing on our GPU server
- ...and lots more!

We hold weekly staff hours to provide assistance with account issues or with OCF services. Drop by to ask questions or just to hang out!

## Interested in free & open-source software?

Our volunteer staff team helps create and maintain the OCF services you use.

We're always on the lookout for new members interested in learning more about technology and open source!
