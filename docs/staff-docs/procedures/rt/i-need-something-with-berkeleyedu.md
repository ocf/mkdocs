# I need [something] with berkeley.edu!

\[under construction\]

## Scenario 1: I need static hosting at \[myorg\].studentorg.berkeley.edu

* To put it simply, **static hosting** is a type of web hosting that does not require a "backend", in other words, a program to be run continuously. In essence, we are just hosting their "static" files.


1. Tell them to read the `Instructions` section at <https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/docs/services/vhost/>

   
   1. They should submit the Virtual Hosting Request form, which will also be delivered to RT.
2. Solve the request: see Virtual Hosting Request page

## Scenario 2: I need app hosting at \[myorg\].studentorg.berkeley.edu

* To put it simply, **app hosting** is a type of web hosting that requires a "backend", in other words, a program to be run continuously. App hosting is a lot harder to configure for the student groups, and demand more resources from our side.


1. You should collect:

   
   1. Group's account name
   2. Group's current website, if any (even if not hosted by OCF)
   3. Desired domain name for the app (group.studentorg.berkeley.edu)
   4. The technologies/languages their site is built on
2. Solve the request: see Virtual Hosting Request page

## Scenario 3: I need mail hosting at \[myorg\].studentorg.berkeley.edu
