# RT Tickets

# Introduction

RT Tickets are a great, beginner-friendly way to get involved at the OCF! When people can't find the help they need in the FAQ or by attending staff hours, they send an email to one of the addresses listed on the [Contact Us](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/docs/contact/) page of the OCF website:

| help@ocf.berkeley.edu | devnull@ocf.berkeley.edu | security@ocf.berkeley.edu |
|----|----|----|
| OCF account help\nInfo on OCF services\nQuestions on joining staff | Promotions for events, services,\nproducts, and opportunities | Concerns about computer\nsecurity, network infrastructure,\nand abuse of resources |

See sub-pages for ticket models.
