General email response templates can be found at
[templates.ocf.berkeley.edu](https://templates.ocf.berkeley.edu)
for purposes such as sending requests for DNS to the University hostmaster,
responding to virtual host requests, and resetting alumni account passwords.
Templates should be used when applicable because they are designed to provide
all necessary information while remaining cordial to the recipient.

Some templates have variables that should be filled out before copying the
template. The template variables will be automatically filled out by entering
text into the input boxes above the main text box. Variables can be located in
the template by looking for `{<variable name>}` before filling it out.

## Adding templates
New templates can be added to the website by submitting a pull request to the
[ocf/templates](https://ocf.io/gh/templates) repo. Template files are found in
`templates/www/templates`. Variables can be added in a template as
`{<variable name>}`.
