title: Staff Documentation
---

The documentation in this section is for current and prospective OCF staff to learn about how the OCF works and how to contribute to it. Find out what we're all about, and come join us!

Feel free to attend our meetings, visit us during staff hours, or contact us by email.

Regular OCF users looking for help should go to the [user docs](../user-docs) instead.
