title: Tech Talks
---

The OCF occasionally hosts tech talks where volunteer staff members share their knowledge, teach others how the OCF works, and explain how to contribute to it. If you're a current member of OCF staff or an alumni and are interested in giving a tech talk, please bring it up at our next Board of Directors meeting!

We record these talks and make them available publicly, along with slides.

We haven't done one in some time, but several lectures from archived semesters of the [OCF DeCal](https://decal.ocf.berkeley.edu/archive/) contain similar content.
