title: General Meetings
---

Currently, these are held every Wednesday 8-9PM, in the lab (171 MLK).

In these meetings, all OCF staff (that includes you!) get together to discuss technology, learn from each other, and work on OCF projects. These meetings are a mix of presentations, work time, and socializing. Our goal is to build OCF staff into a strong community of capable individuals who are passionate about open source software.
