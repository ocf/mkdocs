title: "economode: turn economode on/off on the printers"
---

By default our printers print with the Economode setting off. If you need to save toner, you can use the `economode` script to turn Economode on.

You'll need the printer password, whose location can be found in the
[[private docs|doc staff/private]].

## Usage

```
$ economode on
Enter printer password:
Setting economode to on for papercut... OK
Setting economode to on for pagefault... OK

$ economode off
Enter printer password:
Setting economode to off for papercut... OK
Setting economode to off for pagefault... OK
```
